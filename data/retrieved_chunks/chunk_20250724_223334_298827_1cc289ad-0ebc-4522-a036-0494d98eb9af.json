  "content": "An analysis from The Outcomes Registry for Better Informed Treatment of Atrial Fibrillation (ORBIT-AF) registry11 enrolled 9.484 patients, of whom 2,963 underwent hospitalization with a 20%/year rate of cardiovascular hospitalizations at 1 year. This rate is probably driven by the high cardiovascular risk profile of patients from the ORBIT-AF registry, with high prevalence of previous CAD (33% vs 17.1% of our cohort), HF (33% vs 14.1% of our cohort), and low use of anticoagulants (76.8%, of which 4.8% on DOAC [only dabigatran was administered]).11 The type of anti-arrhythmic drugs was not reported.\nIn our cohort, we found an IR of AF recurrence of 2.0%/year. These data are consistent with a previous study in which an IR of 1.62%/year of AF recurrence was observed in patients with AF.12",
