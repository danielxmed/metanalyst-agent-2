  "content": "Amiodarone\nHigh‐certainty evidence showed a reduction of atrial fibrillation recurrences with amiodarone of about a half, compared to placebo or no treatment (RR 0.52, 95% CI 0.46 to 0.58; studies = 6, participants = 812; I 2 = 33%; Analysis 6.13). This corresponded to a recurrence rate of 81.2% in people not receiving active treatment and 42.2% (95% CI 37.3% to 47.1%) in people receiving amiodarone. The NNTB for amiodarone was 3 (95% CI 2 to 4) participants treated for one year to avoid one recurrence.\nAll sensitivity analyses obtained very similar results (Analysis 6.14; Analysis 6.15; Analysis 6.16).\nDofetilide",
