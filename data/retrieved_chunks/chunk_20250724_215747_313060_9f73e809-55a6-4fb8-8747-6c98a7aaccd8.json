  "content": "It has been shown, however, that beta-blocking drugs are safe and improve the prognosis in patients with hypertension, after myocardial infarction and in patients with heart failure (32–37). Thus, the use of beta-blocking agents does not raise safety concerns. This study is the first to clearly show that metoprolol CR/XL is effective in preventing a relapse of atrial fibrillation after cardioversion to sinus rhythm (Figs. 2 and 3).\nEfficacy of treatment",
