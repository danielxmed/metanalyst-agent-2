The mean ventricular response rate during at least 30 s of the first episode of atrial fibrillation was 135.5 ± 31.3 beats/min in the placebo group and 128.8 ± 28.7 beats/min in the amiodarone-treated group (p = 0.26). Average hospital charges for the placebo group were $18,889; for the amiodarone group (p = 0.18), hospital charges averaged $16,871.",
