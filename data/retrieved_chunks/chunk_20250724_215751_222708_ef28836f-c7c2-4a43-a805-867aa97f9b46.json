  "content": "Amiodarone, commonly used to treat various types of arrhythmias, can potentially lead to catastrophic adverse effects like amiodarone-induced thyrotoxicosis (AIT). This review offers insights into diagnosing and managing AIT, involving thyroid function tests, imaging techniques, and strategies to prevent cardiac deterioration and reduce mortality. The approach to managing AIT has shifted from focusing on thyrotoxicosis control to a broader strategy that includes preventing heart deterioration, hospitalizations, and reducing mortality. Healthcare professionals should consider the patient's need for amiodarone, side effects, coexisting conditions, and personal perspective",
