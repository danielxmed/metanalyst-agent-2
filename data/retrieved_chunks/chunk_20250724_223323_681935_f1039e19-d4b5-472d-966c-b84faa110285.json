  "content": "Concerns regarding an association between amiodarone and cancer outcomes have been based largely on case reports, observational studies, and a subset of RCTs. A previous meta-analysis9 of RCTs designed to evaluate the effect of amiodarone on sudden cardiac death found a statistically borderline increased risk of cancer-related death with amiodarone. However, this review was restricted to patients at high risk of sudden cardiac death, and the observed risk was driven mainly by trials with 6 to 12 months of follow-up. An alternate explanation for these findings is that amiodarone reduced the short-term risk of sudden cardiac death without impacting all-cause mortality, creating shifts among competing causes of death for patients treated with amiodarone.",
