  "content": "Results\nA total of 12 randomized controlled trials involving 287 AF patients were included. Meta-analysis demonstrated a significant improvement in the 6-minute walk test capacity (SMD=87.87, 95% CI [42.23, 133.51]), static heart rate improvement (SMD=−7.63, 95% CI [−11.42, −3.85]), and cardiopulmonary function enhancement (SMD=2.37, 95% CI [0.96, 3.77]) due to exercise. There was also a significant improvement in the quality of life (SMD=0.720, 95% CI [0.038, 1.402]).\nConclusion",
