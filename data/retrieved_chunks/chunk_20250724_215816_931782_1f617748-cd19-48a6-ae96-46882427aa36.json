  "content": ". When all the conditions were studied, the amiodarone-only group was the only one with a statistically significant reduction in hospital stay compared to the placebo group (p = 0.0441). A previous meta-analysis demonstrated that the prophylactic use of amiodarone significantly reduced the duration of hospital stays following cardiac surgery . The analysis consisted of 19 clinical trials and found that there was an average reduction of 0.6 days in hospitalization duration. While this analysis solely focused on the usage of amiodarone after cardiac surgeries, the purpose of the current review is to indicate the effectiveness of amiodarone prophylaxis for all types of surgeries and arrhythmias",
