  "content": ". The ACC/AHA/ACCP/HRS in contrast acknowledges the often smooth transition from paroxysmal to persistent AF and gives a Class Ia recommendation for first-line catheter ablation for patients with paroxysmal and Class IIa in selected persistent AF patients, based on the SARA (Study of Ablation Versus Antiarrhythmic Drugs in Persistent Atrial Fibrillation) study,60 which is not included in the evaluation of the ESC guideline. Regarding heart failure patients with AF, all guidelines consider catheter ablation as a suitable treatment option in patients with symptomatic AF and HFrEF to improve survival and reduce hospitalizations for heart failure",
