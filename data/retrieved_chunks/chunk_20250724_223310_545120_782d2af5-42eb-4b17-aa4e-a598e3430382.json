  "content": "In direct comparisons between antiarrhythmics (Analysis 5.5), amiodarone reduced the recurrence of atrial fibrillation significantly more than the combined class I drugs (OR 0.36, 95% CI 0.26 to 0.50, P < 0.00001) and dronedarone (OR 0.45, 95% CI 0.31 to 0.63, P < 0.00001, 1 trial, 504 patients), and more than sotalol (OR 0.43, 95% CI 0.33 to 0.56, P < 0.00001). No other significant differences were apparent in comparisons between antiarrhythmics.\nResults for atrial fibrillation recurrence were unchanged in sensitivity analyses.\nOther outcomes",
