  "content": "Treatment Options\n\nBeta-blockers, such as metoprolol CR/XL, may be the first line of treatment to maintain sinus rhythm, especially after myocardial infarction and in patients with chronic heart failure and in those with arterial hypertension 5.\nCalcium channel antagonists or beta-adrenoceptor antagonists (beta-blockers) are generally more appropriate and effective for patients without left ventricular dysfunction 6.\nThe clinical target of rate control should be a ventricular rate below 80-90 bpm at rest 6.\nIntravenous diltiazem, metoprolol, and verapamil can be used for rate control in patients with acute atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular rate, with no statistically significant difference between them in achieving rate control 7.\n\nConsiderations",
