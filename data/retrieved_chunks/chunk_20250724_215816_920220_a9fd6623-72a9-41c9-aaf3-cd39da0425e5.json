  "content": ". The authors compared resource use data, including medications, hospital visits, cardiac procedures, and short-stay and emergen-cy department visits. Here, we estimated the effectiveness (QALY) and mean net cost per year for individual rate- and rhythm-control drugs. Although bisoprolol and amiodarone were the most frequently prescribed drugs during the study period, we found that pro-pranolol was the more cost-effective rate-control drug and that sotalol and pilsicainide were the most cost-effective rhythm-control drugs. These findings were based on a comprehensive calculation of net costs, incremental costs, QALY, and ICER.",
