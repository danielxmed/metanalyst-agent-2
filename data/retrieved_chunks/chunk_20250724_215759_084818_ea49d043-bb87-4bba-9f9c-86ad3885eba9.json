  "content": "Atrial fibrillation developed in 67 of 142 patients assigned to placebo (47% incidence) and in 56 of 158 (35%) patients assigned to amiodarone (p = 0.01), representing a 26% relative risk reduction. The percentages of patients free of atrial fibrillation during hospitalization by treatment group are shown in Figure 1, and confirm a significant reduction in atrial fibrillation in the amiodarone group. Analysis of the Kaplan-Meier curve demonstrates that the drug effect appears to occur in the first few days of treatment. The first episode of atrial fibrillation occurred on postoperative day 2.9 ± 1.2 in the group receiving amiodarone and on day 2.3 ± 1.3 in the placebo group (p < 0.01)",
