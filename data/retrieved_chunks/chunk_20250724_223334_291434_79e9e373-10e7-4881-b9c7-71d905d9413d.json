  "content": "The length of hospital stay did not statistically differ between treatment groups: 7.6 ± 5.9 days for the amiodarone group versus 8.2 ± 6.2 days for the placebo group (p = 0.34). As in other studies, atrial fibrillation was associated with a prolonged length of hospital stay regardless of treatment assignment. Patients who experienced atrial fibrillation had a length of stay of 9.0 ± 5.1 days; the length of hospital stay in those patients free of atrial fibrillation was 7.1 ± 6.6 days (p < 0.01).\nNonfatal postoperative complications occurred in four (2.5%) patients who received amiodarone and in seven (4.9%) patients receiving placebo (p = 0.27). No deaths (0%) occurred in the amiodarone group, whereas two deaths (1.4%) occurred among patients in the placebo group (p = 0.13) (Table 4).",
