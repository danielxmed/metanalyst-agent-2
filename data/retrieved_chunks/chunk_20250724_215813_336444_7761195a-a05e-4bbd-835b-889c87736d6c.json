  "content": "InterventionPatients were randomly assigned to receive either episodic or continuous amiodarone treatment after electrical cardioversion following amiodarone loading. Episodic amiodarone treatment was discontinued after a month of sinus rhythm and reinitiated if atrial fibrillation relapsed (1 month peri–electrical cardioversion). In the continuous treatment group amiodarone was maintained throughout.\nMain Outcome MeasuresThe primary end point was a composite of amiodarone and underlying heart disease–related major events. The secondary end points were all-cause mortality and cardiovascular hospitalizations.",
