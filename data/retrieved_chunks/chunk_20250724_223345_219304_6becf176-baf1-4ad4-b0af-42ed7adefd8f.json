  "content": ". a) Exercise capacity and quality of life In general, cardiac rehabilitation, coupled with consistent moderate physical activity, has demonstrated efficacy in decreasing the duration of arrhythmia in individuals with paroxysmal and persistent AF. This highlights its potential as a valuable complement to antiarrhythmic therapies . In cases of permanent AF, it is essential to lower the resting ventricular response rate in patients who find drug treatments insufficient or wish to reduce bradycardia therapies such as digitalis. Reducing the resting ventricular response rate is crucial in enhancing symptoms associated with arrhythmia, physical capacity, distance covered in a 6-minute walk test (6-MWT), and overall QoL",
