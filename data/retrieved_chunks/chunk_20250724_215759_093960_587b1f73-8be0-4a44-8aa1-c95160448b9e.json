  "content": "On the basis of results at one year, amiodarone showed some advantages with respect to class I and other class III drugs. It was more effective in preventing recurrences of atrial fibrillation, produced no significant pro‚Äêarrhythmia, and was not associated with increases in mortality. However, amiodarone clearly had more adverse effects that placebo and it is known that the frequency of its adverse effects increases over time, so we do not know if the advantages of amiodarone persist with longer treatment.",
