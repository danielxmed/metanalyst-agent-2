The exercise group showed a significant improvement in the exercise capacity of AF patients compared to the control group, especially with exercise intensity>50%, where the improvement in 6-minute walking ability was more pronounced. Furthermore, exercise significantly lowered the static heart rate of AF patients, improving symptoms of rapid heartbeat. The significant improvement effects were observed across different training intensities, periods, and age groups. Regarding cardiopulmonary function, the combined effect size after exercise was SMD=2.37, 95% CI [0.96, 3.77], P<0.05, indicating a significant improvement in cardiopulmonary function in AF patients through exercise, particularly impacting patients younger than 60 years.",
