  "content": "Patients were evaluated 7±2 days after hospital discharge by a home nurse and at 24±9 days in the cardiac-surgery outpatient clinic. Sinus rhythm was present in each patient at the home-nurse visit and the outpatient-clinic visit. After discharge from the hospital, 7 patients who had received amiodarone (14 percent) and 11 who had received placebo (31 percent) were evaluated for acute symptoms by their physicians (P = 0.10). Atrial fibrillation was diagnosed in one patient who had received amiodarone (2 percent) and seven patients who had received placebo (12 percent, P = 0.03) a mean of 12±5 days after discharge. The medical therapy at the time of these episodes of atrial fibrillation is summarized in Table 4.\nTable 4",
