  "content": ". Among the class III agents, amiodarone was the first to have been used. The reported efficacy in converting AF is heterogeneous 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and it has multiple extracardiac side effects. Its relatively good tolerance in the setting of heart failure and ischemic heart disease(14)contributes to the popularity of this drug. Although amiodarone is widely used to control AF, it is not approved in North America for any supraventricular arrhythmia. Our aim was to clarify by meta-analysis the role of amiodarone in the cardioversion of recent-onset AF. This drug was compared with placebo and with class Ic agents in randomized trials. The main outcome measure was restoration of sinus rhythm at 24 h.",
