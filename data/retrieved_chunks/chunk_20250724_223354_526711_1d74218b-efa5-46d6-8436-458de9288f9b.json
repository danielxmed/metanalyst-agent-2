  "content": "The secondary outcome was to investigate a 1-year composite endpoint of AF-related hospitalizations, repeat AF ablation, or AAD use. A blanking period of 3 months was not included in the 1-year follow-up, and patients were censored in case of either death or migration. AF-related hospitalizations included admission for AF and cardioversions, and AAD use included use of amiodarone, dronedarone, or class 1C antiarrhythmics.\nComorbidities and medications",
