  "content": "After taking 600 mg of amiodarone daily for the 4-week loading period, patients underwent an electrical cardioversion if they had not already converted chemically to sinus rhythm (Figure 1). The protocol for electrical cardioversion was described previously.19 In short, patients underwent an electrical cardioversion under general anesthesia and all shocks were applied to the chest in an anterior-lateral paddle configuration. Immediate outcome of the shock was monitored by continuous 12-lead electrocardiogram and rhythm monitoring during 4 hours by telemetry. Thereafter, patients were randomly assigned to receive either episodic or continuous amiodarone treatment. After cardioversion, amiodarone was lowered to a maintenance dose of 200 mg daily",
