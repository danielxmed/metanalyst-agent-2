  "content": "Pooled recurrence rates of atrial fibrillation at 1 year were high: 69% to 84% in controls not receiving antiarrhythmic treatment, reduced to 43% to 67% in patients treated with antiarrhythmics. The corresponding average NNTBs for 1 year, to avoid 1 recurrence of atrial fibrillation, were 3 with amiodarone, 4 with flecainide, 5 with dofetilide and propafenone, 8 with quinidine and sotalol, 9 with dronedarone and metoprolol, and 17 with azimilide (the 95% CI varied between 2 and 60).",
