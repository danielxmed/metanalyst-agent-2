  "content": "Inpatients underwent continuous electrocardiographic (ECG) monitoring. At the outpatient clinic follow-up was performed at least every 3 months. ECGs and a 24-h Holter ECG were recorded regularly or when patients complained of palpitation or other typical clinical symptoms. The efficacy of amiodarone therapy was assessed by using ECG, Holter monitoring, or the recording of a pacemaker. In order to assess adverse effects of amiodarone, spirometry, chest X-ray, KL-6 level, thyroid hormones, and liver function were checked. We checked clinical and demographic data, including past medical history and prior medication, from medical records. Follow-up was terminated in April 2009.\nDefinitions",
