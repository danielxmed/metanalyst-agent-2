  "content": "Although strokes certainly account for much of the functional impairment associated with AF, the rhythm disturbance also decreases quality of life. In the Stroke Prevention in Atrial Fibrillation (SPAF) study cohort, the New York Heart Association functional classification, developed for HF, was an insensitive index of quality of life in patients with AF (78). In another study (79), 47 (68%) of 69 patients with paroxysmal AF considered the dysrhythmia disruptive of their lives. This perception was not associated with either the frequency or duration of symptoms",
