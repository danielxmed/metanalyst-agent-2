  "content": "Tallying the results for patients who had never received cardioversion, amiodarone suppressed AF in 14/16 of the paroxysmal AF patients (88%), and caused spontaneous reversion to SR in 4/4 persistent AF patients (100%), and 1/11 permanent AF patients (9%) (Fig. 1). This translated to the spontaneous achievement of SR in 5/15 non-paroxysmal AF patients (33%) without cardioversion after a median follow-up of 151 days. The time to attainment of SR was within 4 months (mean 40 days) (Fig. 2). Meanwhile, 17 patients (5 in the persistent and 12 in the permanent AF group) received electrical cardioversion",
