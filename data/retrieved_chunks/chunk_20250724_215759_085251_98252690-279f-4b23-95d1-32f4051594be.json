  "content": ".9 Of all class I, II, and III antiarrhythmic drugs, amiodarone is the most effective antiarrhythmic drug in preventing atrial fibrillation.10-13 Amiodarone maintains sinus rhythm in 45% to 70% of the patients during 12 to 54 months of follow-up.11 Unfortunately, amiodarone causes many (noncardiac) adverse events, which are mostly associated with high daily dosages and long-term therapy14,15 but does not increase mortality in patients with heart failure and ischemic heart disease.16,17 Efforts to reduce the adverse event rate by using low-dose amiodarone (≤400 mg/d after adequate loading) suggest that they still may occur. Short-term therapy, however, may be more effective in reducing the occurrence of adverse events",
