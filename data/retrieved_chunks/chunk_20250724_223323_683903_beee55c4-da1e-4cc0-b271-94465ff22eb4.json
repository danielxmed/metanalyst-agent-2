  "content": "Despite the effectiveness of amiodarone in converting AF to sinus rhythm, the meta-analysis of four studies has shown that it is associated more with all-cause mortality than digoxin. However, the studies included in this review show contradicting results. Hofmann et al.  reported that of 100 patients equally randomized to the amiodarone and digoxin group, three deaths occurred; one of the three patients randomized into the amiodarone group died eight days after drug administration, while two patients in the digoxin died due to recurrent pulmonary embolism and developed pulmonary edema. However, this study reports that none of the patients had died directly from the drugs",
