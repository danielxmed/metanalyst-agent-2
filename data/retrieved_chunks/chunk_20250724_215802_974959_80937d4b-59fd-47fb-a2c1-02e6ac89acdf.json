  "content": "C. Quality of Life\nAvailable data suggest that quality of life is considerably impaired in patients with AF compared to age-matched controls. Sustained sinus rhythm is associated with improved quality of life and better exercise performance than AF in some studies but not others (116). In a typical study, a majority of patients with paroxysmal AF considered the arrhythmia disruptive of lifestyle, but this perception was not associated with either the frequency or duration of symptomatic episodes (117).\nVII.
