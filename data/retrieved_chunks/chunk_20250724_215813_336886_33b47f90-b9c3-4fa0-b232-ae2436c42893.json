  "content": "Long-term therapy is aimed at alleviating symptoms and reducing risk from preexcited AF. The most effective therapy is catheter ablation. Even the low annual incidence of sudden death (0.15% to 0.39% over 3- to 10-year follow-up) supports liberal ablation indications.56 Ablation eliminates atrial fibrillation in more than 90% of patients.56,61 Amiodarone is generally not warranted because of its adverse-effect profile. Exceptions might include patients with structural cardiac disease who are not ablation candidates or when other available options have been exhausted.56 Amiodarone is an ACC/AHA/ESC class IIb recommendation in hemodynamically stable patients with AF involving accessory pathway conduction (evidence level B).6",
