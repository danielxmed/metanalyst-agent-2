  "content": "there was no difference in the arrhythmia-free rates at the 6-month follow-up.23 In the AMIO-CAT trial, 212 patients undergoing catheter ablation for paroxysmal or persistent AF were randomly assigned to 8-week use of amiodarone or placebo. Although amiodarone signifi­ cantly prolonged the time to first recurrence during a 3-month blank­ ing period, it did not substantially reduce the incidence of recurrent atrial tachyarrhythmias at 6 months.7 Also, in the EAST-AF trial, 2038 patients who had undergone radiofrequency catheter ablation for paroxysmal, persistent, or long-lasting AF were randomized to ei­ ther 90-day use of class I or III AADs or control",
