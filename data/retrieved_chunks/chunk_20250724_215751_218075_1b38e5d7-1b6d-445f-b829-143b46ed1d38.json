Low-dose amiodarone was not associated with statistically significant increase in pulmonary adverse events but was still associated with thyroid and liver adverse events. In conclusion, the likelihood of experiencing adverse events related to amiodarone was higher than that of placebo. The overall rate of adverse events however, was low, and severe adverse events were rare.",
