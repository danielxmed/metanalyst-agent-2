According to the country subgroup analysis, studies from Turkey and Japan showed no significant difference (P>0.05), while studies from Denmark and Italy had significant results, with SMDs of 115.90, 95% CI [78.14, 153.67] and SMD=151.00, 95% CI [85.60, 216.40], P<0.05 (Table 3). The publication bias analysis chart also shows a relatively stable state (Fig. 3).",
