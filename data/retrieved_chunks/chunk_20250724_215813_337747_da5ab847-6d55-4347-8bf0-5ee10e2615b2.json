  "content": "In our study, the long-term AF recurrence rate was 22.04% (n=95) totally. The long-term AF recurrence rate in the dronedarone group and amiodarone group were 22.71% (n=52) and 21.29% (n=43) respectively. The long-term recurrence rate was not significantly different between groups [hazard ratio (HR),0.962; 95% confidence interval (CI),0.642–1.444; p=0.853] (Table 2 and Figure 1). There were no statistically significant differences in the long-term recurrence rate of atrial fibrillation between the groups when stratified by sex, age, type of AF, etc. (HR,1.033; 95% CI,0.661–1.614; p=0.888) (Table 2). Figure 2 shows that in the adjusted model, high HDL-C level was a protective factor for the long-term recurrence of AF",
