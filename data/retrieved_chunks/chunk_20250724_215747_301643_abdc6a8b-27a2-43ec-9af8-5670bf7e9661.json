  "content": "The main drugs used for medical cardioversion of atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter are flecainide (class Ic), propafenone (class Ic), dofetilide (class III), and amiodarone (class III) . A systematic review showed that intravenous vernakalant (class III), intravenous propafenone (class Ic), and both oral and intravenous flecainide (class Ic) seemed to be significantly more effective than placebo at restoring sinus rhythm within 2 h of administration in recent-onset atrial fibrillation . When they analysed for successful cardioversion within 8â€“24 h, oral amiodarone (class III), oral flecainide (Ic), and both oral and intravenous propafenone (class Ic) seemed to be significantly more effective than placebo .",
