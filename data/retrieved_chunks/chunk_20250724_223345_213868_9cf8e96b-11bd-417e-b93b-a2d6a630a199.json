  "content": "Meta-analysis results\n6-Minute walk test\nThis indicator included a total of 5 studies, with an I 2 of 72.9%, so a random-effects model was used. The analysis results showed a significant improvement in the 6-minute walk test ability for AF patients in the exercise group compared to the control group, with a significant effect size (SMD=87.87, 95% CI [42.23, 133.51], P<0.05) (Fig. 2). This indicates that exercise significantly enhances the walking ability of AF patients. Sensitivity analysis confirmed the stability of the results, SMD=87.87, 95% CI [42.23, 133.51].",
