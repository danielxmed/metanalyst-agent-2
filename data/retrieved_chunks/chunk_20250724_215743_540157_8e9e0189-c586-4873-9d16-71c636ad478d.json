  "content": ". The Atrial Fibrillation Follow-up Investigation of Rhythm Management (AFFIRM) trial showed that beta-blockers (class II) (with or without digoxin (class V)) achieved rate control (rest â‰¤80 beats/min) in 70% of the patients compared with 54% for non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (class IV) (with or without digoxin (class V)) and 58% for digoxin (class V) (used without beta-blockers (class II) or non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (class IV)) . Amiodarone (class III) may also control the heart rate, as it exhibits beta and calcium channel blockade in addition to its antiarrhythmic activity",
