However, there is no evidence whether this is appropriate for postoperative AF.42 Longer AF duration is also associated with an increased risk of stroke, but there was not enough data in the studies included in this meta-analysis to assess either stroke or mortality as a secondary outcome.43 Both amiodarone and beta-blockers have been widely utilised in the therapy of postoperative AF, with current evidence reporting comparable outcomes between both agents.30,44,45 Beta-blockers are one of the medications used in rate control strategy, while amiodarone plays a role in both rate control and rhythm control approaches",
