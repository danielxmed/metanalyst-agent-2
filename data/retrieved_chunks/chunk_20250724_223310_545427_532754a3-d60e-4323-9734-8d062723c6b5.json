  "content": "Abstract\nObjectives:\nWe sought to compare the efficacy and safety of dronedarone versus amiodarone for the prevention of recurrent atrial fibrillation (AF).\nBackground:\nDronedarone is a noniodinated amiodarone congener developed to maintain sinus rhythm. Few data are available to directly compare the efficacy and safety of dronedarone versus amiodarone.\nMethods:\nWe conducted a systematic overview of all randomized controlled trials in which the authors evaluated dronedarone or amiodarone for the prevention of AF. The effect of amiodarone versus dronedarone was summarized by the use of indirect comparison meta-analysis and normal logistic meta-regression models.\nResults:",
