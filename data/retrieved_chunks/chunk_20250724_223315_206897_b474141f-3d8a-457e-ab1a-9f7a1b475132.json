  "content": "The low conversion rate in the amiodarone group may be attributed to the characteristics of the AF population enrolled in this trial. A previous study (3) in AF of â‰¤48 h with a similar dosing regimen suggested that a conversion rate of approximately 20% to 25% would be expected in the amiodarone group within 90 min post-infusion. However, the AVRO study population was older, with greater comorbidities (i.e., structural heart disease and hypertension), and had a longer duration of AF. In other studies, successful cardioversion with amiodarone took several hours and required infusions up to 24 h (16, 17).",
