  "content": "Statistical analysis\nWe used a Mantel-Haenszel fixed-effect model analysis to calculate the risk ratio and 95% confidence interval for each outcome of interest. We evaluated statistical heterogeneity using the I 2 statistic and χ 2 test. We used the threshold of I 2> 50% or χ 2 test P-value <0.10 to indicate significant statistical heterogeneity. We conducted prespecified subgroup and sensitivity analyses for each outcome based on study population (atrial fibrillation or ventricular arrhythmias), daily amiodarone dose (≤ 200 mg daily, > 200 mg daily, or mixed regimen), trial duration (below or above the median study duration), and study risk of bias (low risk of bias in all domains vs high/unclear risk of bias in any domain).\nResults\nCharacteristics of included studies",
