Beta-blockers are strongly recommended to avoid rapid ventricular conduction and tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy. In this Viewpoint article, we discuss an emerging body of evidence that questions beta-blockers as a preferred rate-control therapy in patients with atrial fibrillation.\nKeywords: Atrial fibrillation; Beta-blockers; Diastolic dysfunction; Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction.\nÂ© The Author(s) 2023.
