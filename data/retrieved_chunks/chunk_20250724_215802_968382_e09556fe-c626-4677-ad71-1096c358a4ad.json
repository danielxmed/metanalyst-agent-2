  "content": ".43 In CIRCA-DOSE, a 1-point improvement in the Atrial Fibrillation Effect on Quality of Life score was observed for every absolute reduction in daily AF burden of 15.8 minutes (95% CI: 7.2-24.4; P< 0.001).44 Several randomized controlled trials have also demonstrated improved quality of life, AF and HF symptom burden, and exercise tolerance (as measured by maximal oxygen consumption at peak exercise or 6-minute walk distance) in patients with AF and HF treated with CA compared to those treated with medical therapy",
