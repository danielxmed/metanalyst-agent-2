  "content": "Apart from the higher than expected amiodarone-related morbidity, cardiovascular morbidity (other than bradycardias) was more frequent than anticipated with episodic vs the continuous treatment group. These major events consisted mainly of heart failure, major bleeding, ischemia, and thromboembolic complications. Heart failure hospitalization occurred in 50% of the patients in the presence of atrial fibrillation. A higher heart rate during a relapse of atrial fibrillation after discontinuation of amiodarone therapy may have contributed to this difference. Amiodarone is known to lower heart rate during atrial fibrillation",
