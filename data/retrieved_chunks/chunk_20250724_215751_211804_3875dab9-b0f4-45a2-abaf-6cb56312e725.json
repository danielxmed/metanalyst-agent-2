  "content": ". Side effects may include thyroid dysfunction, pulmonary fibrosis, and hepatic injury, necessitating regular follow-ups. Additionally, amiodarone interacts with several drugs, including anticoagulants, which must be managed to prevent adverse effects. Therefore, a deep understanding of both oral and intravenous formulations, as well as proper dosage adjustments, is essential. The aim of this paper is to provide a comprehensive and updated review on amiodarone’s indications, contraindications, recommended dosages, drug interactions, side effects, and monitoring protocols.",
