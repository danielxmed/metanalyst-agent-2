  "content": "Another interesting result of this review is that metoprolol, a beta‐blocker, also showed a significant reduction in atrial fibrillation recurrence, based on the pooled data from two high‐quality randomised controlled trials (Kuhlkamp 2000; Nergardh 2007). The estimated OR and NNTB for metoprolol were greater (that is it was less effective in reducing recurrences) than for amiodarone and class IC drugs or dofetilide, but not very different from class IA drugs and some class III antiarrhythmics. Besides, no significant difference in preventing recurrences was found between beta‐blockers and sotalol in two other trials (DAPHNE 2008 comparing sotalol against metoprolol or atenolol, and Plewan 2001 against bisoprolol)",
