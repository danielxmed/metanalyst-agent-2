  "content": "In 2 out of 4 patients in the episodic treatment group who were hospitalized for heart failure, atrial fibrillation was present at the time of event, and 3 out of 4 had discontinued amiodarone prior to this event. All patients experiencing bleeding were taking oral anticoagulant therapy. In 3, the INR nearest to the moment of the event was more than 3.5. Thromboembolic complications were only seen in the episodic treatment group, while receiving inadequate anticoagulation therapy (INR<2) and in persistent sinus rhythm. In both treatment strategies, 3 patients died, 1 due to sudden unwitnessed cardiac death in each treatment strategy. Both had discontinued amiodarone treatment for more than 3 months",
