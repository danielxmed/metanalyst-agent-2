  "content": "Study implications\nAlthough electrical cardioversion is considered to be the treatment of choice in patients with chronic atrial fibrillation, amiodarone and propafenone could be used in cases where direct current cardioversion is contraindicated, unavailable or refused. In particular, patients with a small left atrium and/or relatively short-duration chronic atrial fibrillation have a high probability of rapid conversion with both drugs; when the size of the left atrium and the duration of the atrial fibrillation increase, so the likelihood of conversion decreases.",
