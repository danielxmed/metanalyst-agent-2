  "content": "Exposure to amiodarone at low doses was associated with a fourfold increase in the odds of experiencing clinically evident hyperthyroidism or hypothyroidism or chemical thyroid function abnormalities necessitating treatment (Fig. 1d). The unadjusted pooled incidence of this adverse effect was 3.7% in the amiodarone group and 0.4% in the placebo group (Table 3). Previous uncontrolled studies have suggested that thyroid toxicity can be avoided by lowering the maintenance dosage 20, 47. The results of this meta-analysis suggest that a significant increase in the odds of experiencing this adverse effect persists even with the use of low dose amiodarone. These findings are more consistent with earlier European reports by Harris et al",
