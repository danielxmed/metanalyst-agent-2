  "content": ". To this must be added the significant incidence of thromboembolic stroke (5). There is evidence suggesting that the overall complex of adverse reactions can be reduced by restoration and maintenance of sinus rhythm (6)or VR control by AV conduction blocking drugs combined with anticoagulants (7). However, the relative superiority of these two approaches in the treatment of atrial fibrillation is uncertain, but it is the subject of several major ongoing clinical trials.",
