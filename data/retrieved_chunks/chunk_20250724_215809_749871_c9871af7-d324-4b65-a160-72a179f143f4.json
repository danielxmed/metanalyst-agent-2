  "content": "Amiodarone has complex pharmacokinetics. It exhibits variable oral bioavailability, averaging approximately 50% (range, 22%-86%).7 Amiodarone is highly lipophilic, with a large volume of distribution (66 L/kg) resulting in a delayed onset of action (2 days to 3 weeks for oral therapy) and long elimination half-life.8 An initial 50% reduction in plasma concentration 3 to 10 days after cessation of chronic therapy is followed by a longer terminal half-life of 13 to 142 days as tissue stores deplete.7,8 Amiodarone is metabolized by the hepatic cytochrome p450 system and excreted in feces. Renal excretion is minimal (<1% unchanged in urine). The active metabolite of amiodarone, N-desethylamiodarone, has a longer half-life",
