  "content": "Previous studies suggest that both amiodarone and propafenone are highly effective in restoring sinus rhythm in patients with recent onset atrial fibrillation (1â€“8). However, their effect on patients with long-lasting atrial fibrillation, a condition under which chemical agents exhibit their lowest conversion rate, has not been adequately studied.\nThe purpose of the present randomized, comparative, placebo-controlled study was to assess the efficacy and safety of both amiodarone and propafenone in restoring sinus rhythm in patients with chronic atrial fibrillation (lasting >3 weeks).\nMethods\nPatients",
