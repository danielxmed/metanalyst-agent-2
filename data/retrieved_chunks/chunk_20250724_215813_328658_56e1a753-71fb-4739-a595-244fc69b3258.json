  "content": "How can “rhythm control” be obtained? One year after cardioversion more than two thirds of patients present a recurrence of AF [37, 49, 50, 118]. The main risk factors for recurrence are functional NYHA class before cardioversion and non-rheumatic origin of AF . Clinical tri-als have shown that most drugs are more efficient than placebo in maintaining sinus rhythm, but with such poor methodology that recommenda-tions are difficult to formulate [37, 65]. The indi-vidual risks and benefits of each therapeutic agent must be evaluated, and co-morbidities should guide the choice of drug. With amiodarone (100 to 200 mg/d) sinus rhythm is maintained after one year in more than 50% of patients [37, 49, 120, 121]",
