  "content": "Conclusions\nAmiodarone is superior to placebo for cardioversion of AF, and even though the onset of conversion is delayed, its efficacy is similar at 24 h compared with class Ic drugs. These results favor amiodarone as a reasonable alternative for patients with recent AF in whom class Ic and other, more rapidly acting antiarrhythmic drugs cannot be used.",
