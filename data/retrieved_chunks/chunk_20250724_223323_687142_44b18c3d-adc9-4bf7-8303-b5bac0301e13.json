  "content": "Seven patients in the placebo group and 5 patients in the amiodarone group died before the sixth postoperative day. One patient in each group had already had an atrial tachyarrhythmia. By way of a sensitivity analysis, if the 4 incompletely monitored patients in the amiodarone group and none of the 6 incompletely monitored patients in the placebo group were considered to have had postoperative atrial tachyarrhythmia, the difference in postoperative atrial tachyarrhythmia incidence remains significantly lower in patients randomized to amiodarone compared with those randomized to placebo (HR, 0.54 [95% CI, 0.38-0.75]; P<.001).",
