  "content": "Management of the condition has evolved over time and there has been a therapeutic paradigm shift away from concentrating solely on prevention of AF recurrence towards ventricular rate control, based on so-called “rate versus rhythm control” randomized trials conducted >2 decades ago.5-8 With the more recent development of targeted therapies aimed specifically at restoration and maintenance of sinus rhythm with antiarrhythmic drugs (AADs) and left atrial ablation, it became necessary to re-assess their impact on major adverse cardiovascular outcomes, such as death, stroke, systemic embolism, or progression of heart failure, as well as AF recurrence and quality of life (QoL)",
