  "content": ". This meta-analysis aimed to compare the efficacy of both agents in preventing postoperative AF after cardiac surgery. Methods: We explored online medical databases, such as CINAHL, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and EMBASE for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing amiodarone and beta-blocker for prevention of AF after cardiac surgery. Outcomes analysed in this study were AF number of events and duration, hospital stay, and mean ventricular rate. Heterogeneity was assessed using the I² test, and publication bias was analysed using Egger’s test. Results: In total, eight RCTs comprising 1370 patients met the inclusion criteria. Pooled analysis showed that patients in both groups had no significant difference in both AF episodes (RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.66 to 1.04, p=0.10) and AF duration (SMD 0",
