  "content": ". Amiodarone, particularly if co-administered with beta-blockers, reduces the rate of arrhythmic death due to ventricular tachyarrhythmias in patients with heart failure, but its benefit on cardiovascular and overall survival in these patients is uncertain. In addition, amiodarone is an important adjuvant drug for the reduction of shocks in patients with an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator. Due to its beneficial pharmacological profile amiodarone became the most prescribed antiarrhythmic drug over the past 40 years. Nevertheless, the slow onset of its antiarrhythmic action requires a loading dose and the high risk of non-cardiac toxicity and common drug-drug interactions limit its long-term use",
