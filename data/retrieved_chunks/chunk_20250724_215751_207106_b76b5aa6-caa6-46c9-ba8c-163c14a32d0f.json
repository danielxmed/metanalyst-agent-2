  "content": "Thyroid problems have been documented in up to 14â€“18% of patients taking long-term amiodarone therapy, according to a meta-analysis published in 2009 by Mini Gopalan, whereas the frequency is 3.7% in individuals using low dosages of Amiodarone. The side effects include aberrant thyroid function test findings for apparent thyroid dysfunction, which could be Amiodarone-induced thyrotoxicosis (AIT) or Amiodarone-induced hypothyroidism (AIH) . In our study, we found that patients developed thyroid problems at doses as low as 700 mg/week, which is likewise a modest dose.",
