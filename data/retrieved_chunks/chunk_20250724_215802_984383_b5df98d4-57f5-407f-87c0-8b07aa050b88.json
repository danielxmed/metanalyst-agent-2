  "content": "The findings of this study further confirm these mechanisms, revealing the specific effects of exercise training on the improvement of exercise capacity and quality of life in atrial fibrillation patients. Through regular exercise interventions, significant improvements are observed in the myocardial and vascular functions of atrial fibrillation patients. This discovery provides empirical support for the exercise prescription for atrial fibrillation patients, emphasizing the importance of personalized exercise plans in improving cardiorespiratory health in this patient population.",
