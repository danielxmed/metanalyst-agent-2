  "content": "Quiz Ref ID Conversion rates with amiodarone have never been superior, and conversion occurs faster with other antiarrythmic drugs.41-48 Therefore, amiodarone's role in chemical cardioversion of AF is limited. We recommend trying ibutilide or dofetilide before amiodarone in patients with left ventricular dysfunction when restoring sinus rhythm seems clinically important. ACC/AHA/ESC guidelines support amiodarone as an alternative when conversion to sinus rhythm is necessary (class IIa recommendation, evidence level A).6",
