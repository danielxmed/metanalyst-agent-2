  "content": "Pharmacologic Management\n\nIntravenous beta blockers and calcium channel blockers are equally effective in rapidly controlling the ventricular rate in acute AF in selected individuals 6\nThe addition of digoxin to the regimen causes a favorable outcome, however, digoxin as a single agent is generally inefficacious in slowing the ventricular rate in acute AF 6\nDiltiazem may be more effective than metoprolol in achieving rapid rate control, but high-quality randomized studies are needed 7\nMetoprolol had a lower failure rate than amiodarone and was superior to diltiazem in achieving rate control at 4 h 8\n\nAnticoagulation and Disposition",
