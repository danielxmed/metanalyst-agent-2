  "content": "Although the effectiveness of these two drugs in the cardioversion of recent onset atrial fibrillation has been well documented, their effectiveness in cases of chronic atrial fibrillation has not been studied adequately. Existing studies of amiodarone or propafenone are few and include small numbers of patients. Furthermore, most of them did not use a placebo control group, and so the real value of their findings is limited (1–4,6–8,10). For this reason, our study was structured in such a way as to enable us both to evaluate the real efficacy and safety of the two drugs tested for the conversion of chronic atrial fibrillation and to make a comparison between them.\nEfficacy of the drugs",
