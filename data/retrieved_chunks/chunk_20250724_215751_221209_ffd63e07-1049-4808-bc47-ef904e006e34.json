  "content": "Amiodarone has been associated with adverse events that may restrict its use. We performed a meta-analysis of placebo-controlled trials to assess the relative risk of adverse events of amiodarone compared with placebo. In total, 43 randomized trials were included. A total of 11,395 patients were included (5,792 patients randomized to amiodarone and 5,603 patients randomized to placebo). The incident rate of adverse events per 10,000 person-years was higher in the amiodarone group compared with placebo for pulmonary (129 vs 74; relative risk (RR) 1.77, p = 0.002), thyroid (201 vs 42; RR 4.44, p <0.001), hepatic (54 vs 25; RR 2.27, p = 0.01), cardiac (771 vs 450; RR 1.94, p <0.001), neurological (140 vs 76; RR 1.93, p <0.001), and skin (81 vs 23; RR 1.99, p = 0.04) adverse events",
