  "content": "The odds of experiencing thyroid, neurologic, skin, ocular and bradycardic adverse effects was significantly increased with low dose amiodarone exposure compared with placebo (p < 0.05 for each adverse effect). For these adverse effects, the combined mean ORs ranged from 4.2 (thyroid) to 2.0 (neurologic) and the 95% CIs were to the right of the unity line (Fig. 1, d to h). The unadjusted pooled incidence of each of these adverse effects was <5% in the amiodarone group and <2% in the placebo group.",
