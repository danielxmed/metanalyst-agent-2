  "content": "RESULTS\nConversion to sinus rhythm was achieved in 16 (47.05%) patients who received amiodarone, in 13 (40.62%) who received propafenone and in none of the control subjects (p < 0.001 for both groups vs. control subjects). Those who converted had smaller atria than those who did not and atrial fibrillation of shorter duration in both the amiodarone and propafenone groups. Treatment was discontinued in one patient of the propafenone group because of significant QRS widening.\nCONCLUSIONS\nAmiodarone and propafenone appear to be safe and equally effective in the termination of chronic atrial fibrillation. Left atrial diameter and arrhythmia duration are independent predictors of conversion.",
