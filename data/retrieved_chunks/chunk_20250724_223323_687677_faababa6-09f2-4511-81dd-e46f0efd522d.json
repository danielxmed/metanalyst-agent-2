  "content": ". A recent prospective, randomized trial comparing the empirical administration of amiodarone with the administration of other drugs on the basis of electrophysiologic study or Holter monitoring22 showed that a significantly smaller percentage of patients receiving amiodarone reached a combined end point (death from cardiac causes, resuscitation after cardiac arrest, or electrical shock from an implanted defibrillator), but there was no significant difference in mortality between the two groups.",
