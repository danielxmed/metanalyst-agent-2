  "content": "Regarding other outcomes, our results showed that all the antiarrhythmic drugs studied reduced the recurrence of atrial fibrillation. However, the effectiveness of antiarrhythmics was limited: they reduced recurrences by 20% to 50% compared to controls, which meant that atrial fibrillation still recurred in many participants (43% to 67%) treated with antiarrhythmics at one year. Amiodarone seemed to be the most effective drug in preventing recurrences as it had the lowest RR and in head‐to‐head comparisons it was better than combined class I drugs, dronedarone or sotalol. In spite of this, atrial fibrillation recurred at one year in 43% of participants treated with amiodarone.",
