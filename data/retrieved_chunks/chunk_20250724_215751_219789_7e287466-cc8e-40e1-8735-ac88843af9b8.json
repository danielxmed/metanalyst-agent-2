  "content": "Amiodarone is commonly used in a broad spectrum of arrhythmia including life-threatening ventricular arrhythmia and atrial fibrillation that are resistant to other drugs. Unfortunately, amiodarone can potentially lead to catastrophic adverse effects, such as AIT. AIT causes detrimental effects on cardiac conditions, specifically in reducing systolic function. The mortality rate was even particularly higher in patients with LVEF < 40%. The approach to managing AIT has evolved from focusing on controlling thyrotoxicosis (an endocrine perspective) to a broader strategy aimed at preventing heart deterioration, hospitalizations, and reducing mortality (a general perspective). Effective management of AIT extends beyond thyroid function control to address cardiac outcomes and mortality risks",
