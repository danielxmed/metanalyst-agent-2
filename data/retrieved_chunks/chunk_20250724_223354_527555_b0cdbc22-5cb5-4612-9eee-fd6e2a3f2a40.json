  "content": "Follow-up\nAll patients were routinely followed up every 3 months in an outpatient clinic by the study investigators or by local referring physicians throughout the study period. During follow-up visits, serum creatinine, electrolytes, and electrocardiography were assessed. Patients were instructed to call a dedicated nurse if they experienced symptoms suggestive of an arrhythmia. Their rhythm status was monitored by event recorders, serial electrocardiograms, remote device monitoring, and extended Holter monitors. Any episode of an atrial arrhythmia >30 s was considered as a recurrence.\nStudy outcomes",
