The mean follow-up duration was 325.9 Â± 81.6 days and was similar between the groups (P=0.98). During the follow-up period, recurrence of atrial arrhythmias was detected in 164 of 1,086 (15.1%) patients in the first-line ablation group and in 169 of 997 (17.0%) patients in the second-line catheter ablation group (P=0.26). Figure 3 shows the Kaplan-Meyer survival curve for the atrial arrhythmia recurrence rate. There was no difference between the groups as indicated by an HR of 1.13 (95%CI: 0.92-1.41; P=0.25).",
