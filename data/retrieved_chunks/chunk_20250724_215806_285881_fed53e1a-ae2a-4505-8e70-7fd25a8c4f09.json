  "content": ". The 2016 Taiwan AF guideline also recommends dronedarone or sotalol as a first-line AAD therapy for patients with CAD . Amiodarone also should not be used as a first-line therapy, and class Ic drugs cannot be used in patients with CAD. However, our study revealed that 19.7% of patients with AF and CAD took class Ic drugs. In the AIM-AF survey, 6% of the respondents who were physicians from the US and Europe also selected class Ic drugs as a typical treatment choice for patients with CAD . 53.5% of patients in our study cohort took amiodarone as first-line AAD. Therefore, guideline nonadherence was frequently observed among physicians all around the world. It also appeared that flecainide was not associated with increased mortality in patients with stable nonobstructive CAD [38,39]",
