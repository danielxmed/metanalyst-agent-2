  "content": "Discussion\nThis analysis from the ARISTOTLE study included 2,051 patients who received amiodarone, which represented one of the largest experiences to date with amiodarone for AF in a clinical trial. The main findings were as follows: 1) amiodarone use was associated with a significantly increased risk of stroke and systemic embolism, and a lower time in the TTR when used with warfarin; 2) apixaban consistently reduced the rate of stroke and systemic embolism, death, and major bleeding compared with warfarin in amiodarone patients and patients not on amiodarone (Central Illustration); and 3) the relative reductions in stroke and systemic embolism, mortality, and major bleeding with apixaban compared with warfarin were similar with and without amiodarone use.\nOpen in Viewer",
