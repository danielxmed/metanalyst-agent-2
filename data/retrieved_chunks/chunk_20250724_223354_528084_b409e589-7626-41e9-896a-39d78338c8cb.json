  "content": "The details of the study (SAFE-T) design from which the data are derived have been reported previously (11). In brief, patients with persistent AF were randomly assigned double-blind to amiodarone, sotalol, or placebo after optimal anticoagulation (international normalized ratio 2 to 3). After 4 weeks of therapy, those not in SR had their AF electrically cardioverted. Once SR was achieved, anticoagulation was continued for at least 8 weeks thereafter. Recurrence of AF was documented by weekly transtelephonic monitoring. All patients were followed for at least 1 year. Patients remaining in SR were maintained on their originally assigned treatment. Those who remained in or reverted to AF after a second cardioversion were placed on open-label medications with continued follow-up to 1 year",
