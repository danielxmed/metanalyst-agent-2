  "content": "Results: During an average follow-up period of 14.28 months, the long-term recurrence rate of AF did not differ significantly between the amiodarone group and dronedarone group (22.71% vs 21.29%, hazard ratio [HR], 1.033, 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.661– 1.614; p=0.888). The recurrence rate in the blanking period also showed no statistically significant differences between the amiodarone group and dronedarone group (9.90% vs 14.41%, HR, 0.851; 95% CI, 0.463–1.564; p=0.604). The re-hospitalization rates for re-ablation between two groups did not differ between the amiodarone group and dronedarone group (4.65% vs 13.46%; p =0.144). The incidence of ADE was higher in the dronedarone groups than that in the amiodarone group (16.59% vs 5.45%, p <0.001)",
