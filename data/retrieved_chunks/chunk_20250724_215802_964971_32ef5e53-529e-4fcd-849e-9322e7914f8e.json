  "content": "Information about the effects of antiarrhythmic and chronotropic therapies on quality of life is inconsistent (116,130,131). Neither the AFFIRM (132), RACE (124), PIAF (Pharmacologic Intervention in Atrial Fibrillation) (125), nor STAF (Strategies of Treatment of Atrial Fibrillation) (126) studies found differences in quality of life with rhythm control compared with rate control. Rhythm control in the PIAF and HOT CAFÉ (How to Treat Chronic Atrial Fibrillation) (127) studies resulted in better exercise tolerance than rate control, but this did not translate into improved quality of life. Symptomatic improvement has been reported after the maze procedure in patients with AF (133)",
