  "content": "The percentage of patients being in sinus rhythm in the rhythm-control group (rate-control group) after up to four cardioversions (255 primarily successful cardioversions during the total follow-up period) during the follow-up period was 70% after randomization (2%), 53% (13%) at one month, 46% (16%) at three months, 49% (11%) at six months, 40% (12%) at 12 months, 34% (8%) at 18 months, 26% (11%) at 24 months, and 23% (0) at 36 months. Initial cardioversion had been successful in 84% of patients, whereas 70% of patients maintained sinus rhythm after the initial treatment period of one to seven days. In the rhythm-control group 86% of patients received some kind of antiarrhythmic treatment, with 42% receiving amiodarone according to the study protocol",
