Hospital mortality\nWe found no significant differences between beta blockers (aHR 1.03 [0.53–2.03]), CCBs (aHR 1.30 [0.61–2.76)), or electrical cardioversion (aHR 0.96 [0.31–3.01]) in hospital mortality versus amiodarone in the USA database. Similarly, no differences were identified between beta blockers (aHR 0.75 [0.30–1.86]) or digoxin (aHR 1.40 [0.77–2.56]) versus amiodarone in hospital mortality in the UK database.\nBeta blockers therapy appeared to be associated with reduced mortality in the combined dataset prior to adjustment, however, after adjustment, the difference was no longer evident (aHR 1.03 [0.53–2.03]), consistent with our individual database analyses ((Supplementary Table S10, Additional File 2).\n3.7.
