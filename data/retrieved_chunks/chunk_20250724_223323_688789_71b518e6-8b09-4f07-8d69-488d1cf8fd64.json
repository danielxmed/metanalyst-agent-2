  "content": "In the UK database, digoxin was not significantly associated with inferior rhythm control (aHR 0.67 [0.41–1.09]) versus amiodarone. As in the USA database, beta blocker therapy was not associated with any significant difference in time to rhythm control (aHR 0.99 ([0.57–1.72]).\nIn the combined database analysis of beta blockers versus amiodarone, rhythm control with amiodarone appeared superior in the unadjusted analysis, however, after adjustment, the difference was no longer evident (aHR 0.85, [0.69–1.05]), consistent with our individual database analyses (Supplementary Table S10, Additional File 2).\n3.6.3.
