  "content": "Intravenous amiodarone, like the oral form, would be expected to interact with a large number of other drugs, either pharmacokinetically or pharmacodynamically, especially when used for several days (). Amiodarone inhibits the action of subtypes of the cytochrome P-450 enzyme system. It will increase the levels of several drugs that are thus metabolized, including quinidine, procainamide and warfarin ([25, 26]). The mechanism of the interaction between amiodarone and digoxin is complex, but amiodarone may double steady state digoxin plasma levels when administered concomitantly (). In addition, drugs such as barbiturates should decrease, and cimetidine may increase, serum amiodarone concentrations",
