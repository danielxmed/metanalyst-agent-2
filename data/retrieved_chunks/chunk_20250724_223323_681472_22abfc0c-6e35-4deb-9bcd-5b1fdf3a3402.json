Despite amiodarone showing a significant conversion, the study reports that its use was affected by the number of deaths observed. The results show that 13 deaths (six sudden) were observed in the amiodarone group. A large cohort study of 122,465 patients also reported that amiodarone use for the treatment of AF was associated with an increased risk of death . Additionally, the use of amiodarone in treating patients with an increased risk of sudden cardiac deaths, such as those with heart failure, has also been associated with high all-cause mortality rates",
