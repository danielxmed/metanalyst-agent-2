Postoperative sustained ventricular tachyarrhythmias occurred less frequently in amiodarone patients (1/299; 0.3%) than in placebo patients (8/302; 2.6%) (P=.04). Dosage reductions of blinded therapy were more common in amiodarone patients (34/299; 11.4%) than in placebo patients (16/302; 5.3%) (P=.008). There were no differences in serious postoperative complications, in-hospital mortality, or readmission to the hospital within 6 months of discharge or in 1-year mortality.",
