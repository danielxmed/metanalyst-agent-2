  "content": ". It was not possible to examine the risk of bradycardia, hypotension, stroke, and mortality, which are commonly associated with atrial fibrillation, due to a lack of data. It should also be pointed out that in this study, we compared amiodarone with all types of beta-blockers, including sotalol. Each beta-blocker differs in properties, and some patients may benefit more from a specific type of beta-blockers but less from another.",
