  "content": "Methods and results Ninety-eight patients with persistent AF from the DECAAF II trial with pre-ablation follow-up were included. Patients re­ corded daily single-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) strips, defining AF burden as the proportion of AF days among total submitted ECG days. The primary outcome was atrial arrhythmia recurrence. The AF severity scale was administered pre-ablation and at 12 months post-ablation. At follow-up, 69 patients had atrial arrhythmia recurrence and 29 remained in sinus rhythm. These patients were categorized into a recurrence (n = 69) and a no-recurrence group (n = 29). Both groups had similar baseline characteristics, but recurrence patients were older (P = 0.005), had a higher prevalence of hyper­ lipidaemia (P = 0",
