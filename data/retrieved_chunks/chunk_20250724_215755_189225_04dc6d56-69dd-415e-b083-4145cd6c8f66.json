  "content": "Many antiarrhythmic drugs carry the cardiovascular side effects of bradycardia, hypotension, and Torsades de Pointes. As a result, many are contraindicated in patients who have ischemic or structural heart disease, heart failure, or other arrhythmias such as Wolff-Parkinson-White. Furthermore, numerous antiarrhythmic drugs inhibit the CYP system, creating potential adverse reactions with other medications that may require routine hepatic and renal monitoring [15,16]. Multiple studies have reported the risk of major complications in ablation being anywhere from 2% to 5%, with the most notable complications including tamponade, pneumothorax, and pulmonary vein stenosis requiring further intervention [17,18]",
