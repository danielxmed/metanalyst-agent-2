  "content": "Amiodarone, a benzofuran derivative containing 37% iodine, affects thyroid function through iodine overload and direct cytotoxic effects. Its structural similarity to thyroid hormones contributes to its dual antagonistic and agonistic actions on thyroid tissues.6 This drug causes prolongation of the action potential of both atrial and ventricular tissue. Following oral administration, the drug experiences incomplete and variable absorption, with bioavailability ranging from 22% to 86%. Peak serum concentrations occur 2 to 10 h after an oral dose. Amiodarone has a large volume of distribution and is widely distributed in body tissues",
