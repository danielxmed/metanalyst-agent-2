  "content": ".21-23,30,31 Since economic factors may play a considerable role in selecting treatment op-tions, several authors have investigated the cost-effectiveness of rhythm- versus rate-control strategies for treating AF.24,32-34 Eckman, et al.32 showed that cardioversion followed by the use of warfarin and amiodarone was the most effective strategy among several antiarrhythmic and antithrombotic treatment options. Catherwood, et al.33 found that cardioversion with or without antiarrhythmic drugs was more effective and less costly than rate-control drugs. Hagens, et al.34 demonstrated that treatment costs were higher for rhythm-control than rate-con-trol drugs due to the higher costs of electrical cardioversion, Table 3",
