  "content": "Figure 1\nThe prevalence of atrial fibrillation occurring during hospitalization in the amiodarone group was 23 percent (15 of 64 patients), as compared with 42 percent (25 of 60 patients) in the placebo group (P = 0.03). Atrial fibrillation occurred a mean of 2.5±1.7 days after surgery in the patients assigned to amiodarone and 2.7±1.6 days after surgery in the patients assigned to placebo (P = 0.79). The maximal ventricular rate during atrial fibrillation was significantly lower in the amiodarone group than in the placebo group (112±21 vs. 135±31 beats per minute, P = 0.03); however, there was no significant difference between the groups in the duration of atrial fibrillation (13.8±13.4 vs. 9.3±10.3 hours, P = 0.27 by Student's t-test) (Table 3).\nTable 3",
