  "content": "In our meta-analysis comprising eight studies, there was no difference in postoperative AF episodes between the amiodarone and beta-blockers groups. This result supports the findings from a similar meta-analysis conducted in 2012.15 Furthermore, this study found no difference between both groups in duration of AF, hospital length of stay, and mean ventricular rate. It could be implied that both drugs are equally effective in preventing postoperative AF. Therefore, in clinical practice, it is more appropriate to make an individual decision for each case rather than to follow a prespecified general guideline.",
