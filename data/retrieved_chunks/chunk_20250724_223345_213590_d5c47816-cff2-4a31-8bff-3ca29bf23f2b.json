  "content": "A substantial amount of past research has confirmed the beneficial effects of exercise on atrial fibrillation.33, 34 Building upon existing research, this study further explores the general impact of exercise on AF patients across different training intensities and durations. Ortaga (2022) study confirmed the positive effects of regular moderate-intensity exercise on improving exercise tolerance in AF patients.35 This study specifically highlights a more significant improvement in the 6-minute walking test when exercise intensity exceeds 50%, providing a new perspective to this field. Additionally, our findings align with Moral et al.’s (2018) results,35 further confirming the influence of moderate-intensity exercise on exercise tolerance in AF patients. The study by Williams et al",
