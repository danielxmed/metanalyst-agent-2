  "content": "However, beta-blockers have an excellent safety profile, so reduced efficacy might be acceptable in a first-line agent when the lack of proarrhythmia and serious side effects are considered. In addition, beta-blockers are a good first choice in therapy for the control of the ventricular response in AF, since they control the ventricular response better than digoxin should AF recur. One must keep in mind that this heart rate control may be responsible for reducing symptoms of AF, making it even more important to continue anticoagulation.\nTreatment of symptomatic AF: issues of anticoagulation",
