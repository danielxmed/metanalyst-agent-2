  "content": "Length of Hospital Stay and Total Costs\nThe patients in the amiodarone group were hospitalized for significantly fewer days than those in the placebo group (6.5 ±2.6 vs. 7.9±4.3 days, P = 0.04). In the amiodarone group, the mean length of stay was 7.9±4.6 days for the patients with atrial fibrillation and 6.1±1.3 days for those without atrial fibrillation (P = 0.02). In the placebo group, the patients with episodes of atrial fibrillation were also hospitalized for significantly more days (9.4±3.6 vs. 6.8±4.5 days, P = 0.02). The mean total cost of hospitalization for the amiodarone group was $18,375±$13,863, as compared with $26,491±$23,837 for the placebo group (P=0.03).\nMorbidity and Mortality in the Hospital",
