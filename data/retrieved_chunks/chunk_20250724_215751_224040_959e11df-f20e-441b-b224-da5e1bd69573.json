  "content": ".9,10 Amiodarone is the most widely used and effective AAD for maintaining sinus rhythm; however, it is associated with pulmonary toxicity, thyroid disorders, and hepatic toxicity, which may necessitate discontinuation of the drug or lead to severe complications with prolonged use.11 Sotalol has minimal non-cardiovascular (CV) adverse effects but increase risk of all-cause mortality.7,12 Dronedarone, designed as an analogue of amiodarone, has demonstrated to be less effective than amiodarone in reducing AF recurrence or premature study discontinuation at 12 months (hazard ratio [HR] 1.59; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.28–1.98; P< 0.0001), whereas it was associated with a better safety profile due to fewer adverse effects or premature discontinuation (HR = 0.80; 95% CI, 0.60–1.07; P = 0",
