  "content": "The maintenance of SR after cardioversion or reversion to SR may not be solely attributable to antiarrhythmic properties of amiodarone. Improvement of CHF and the effects of up-stream treatment by angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers would also support SR maintenance . It is hard to distinguish between amiodarone effect and other factors.\nFinally, the median follow-up duration of 265 days was not so long.\nConclusion\nOral amiodarone had clinical value in restoration and maintenance of SR in CHF patients with paroxysmal and persistent AF. The successful rhythm control resulted in the improvement of LVEF and the decrease in BNP levels. However, its utility appeared to be limited in those with advanced atrial anatomical remodeling of patients with CHF.",
