  "content": "Base Case Analysis\nThe results of the base-case analysis are shown in Table 2. For all paroxysmal or persistent patients with AF, in comparison with amiodarone and sotalol, dronedarone was expected to gain additional 1.28 QALYs (5.15 vs 3.87) and 1.78 QALYs (5.15 vs 3.37) over a lifetime horizon, with higher costs of $6632 ($11,025 vs $4393) and $6278 ($11,025 vs $4748), respectively. The averaged ICER values for dronedarone versus amiodarone and sotalol were $5166 and $3524 per QALY gained, respectively. For\nDiscussion",
