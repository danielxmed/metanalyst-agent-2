  "content": "Beta-blockers generally have not been considered to be atrial stabilizing agents except in two well-defined situations. First, a small population of patients experience recurrent AF in association with stress or anxiety; these patients with adrenergically mediated AF may respond well to beta-blockade (as opposed to the opposite syndrome of vagally mediated AF, in which beta-blockers may exacerbate AF and treatment with agents possessing anticholinergic properties is desirable). Second, and more common, is the use of beta-blockers for prevention of AF in patients following cardiothoracic surgery, in which AF occurs in approximately 30% of patients (3)",
