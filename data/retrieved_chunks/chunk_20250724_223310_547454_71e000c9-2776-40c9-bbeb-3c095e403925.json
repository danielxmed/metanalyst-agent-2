  "content": "Abstract\nObjectives\nThe study’s goal was to compare the efficacy and safety of dofetilide (DOF) versus amiodarone (AMIO) in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF).\nBackground\nComparative efficacy of DOF versus AMIO in patients with AF has not been well established. In addition, proarrhythmia has been a concern with DOF therapy.\nMethods\nRhythm control was attempted by using DOF in 657 consecutive patients (mean age 72 ± 9 years; 35% women) with AF (n = 528) or atrial flutter and AF (n = 129) between January 2014 and December 2018.\nResults",
