  "content": "Amiodarone is a potent antiarrhythmic drug commonly used for treating both ven-tricular and atrial arrhythmia in ordinary practice. Taking into consideration the wide-spread use of this medication, it is necessary for practitioners to be well-informed about its indications, contraindications, dosing recommendations, side e ff ects, and potential drug interactions. Despite its e ff ectiveness, amiodarone is associated with a wide range of potential adverse e ff ects, from well-studied issues like thyroid dysfunction and pulmo-nary toxicity to less commonly recognized e ff ects, such as neuromuscular toxicity. This underscores the importance of proper and constant evaluation of the patients through their treatment",
