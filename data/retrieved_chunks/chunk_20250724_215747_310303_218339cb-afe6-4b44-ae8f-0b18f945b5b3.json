  "content": "Landiolol, metoprolol, and esmolol were investigated in observational studies. Okajima and colleagues45 reported a significant difference in rates of cardioversion to SR at 24 h between landiolol and control (27/39 [69.7%] vs 8/22 [36.4%], P=0.05). Balik and colleagues40 compared cardioversion rates at 24 h between amiodarone, propafenone, and metoprolol. Cardioversion rates for metoprolol were 12/13 (92.3%) compared with 111/151 (73.5%) for amiodarone and 32/36 (88.9%) for propafenone.40 Milojevic and colleagues37 reported a significant difference in rates of cardioversion to SR between esmolol and amiodarone (44/100 [44%] vs 36/200 [18%], P<0.01). However, Milojevic and colleagues37 reported cardioversion to SR at shortly after commencement of treatment at 40 min.",
