  "content": "Amiodarone hydrochloride is a class III antiarrhythmic drug prescribed commonly for atrial fibrillation and ventricular arrhythmias. It has several clinically important toxic effects, including pneumonitis, hepatotoxicity, thyroid dysfunction, and corneal microdeposits with visual disturbances.1-3 The initial experience with this drug also suggested substantial potential for neurologic toxic effects, with frequencies in these early reports ranging from 27.5% to as high as 74%1,2,4-6; the most common of these neurologic adverse effects have been tremor, ataxia, and peripheral neuropathy. However, various other neurologic adverse effects have also been reported, including cognitive impairment/encephalopathy,4,6,7 parkinsonism,8,9 optic neuropathy,10 and myopathy",
