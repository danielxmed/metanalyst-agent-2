  "content": "Conclusions\nThe present analysis using Markov modeling based on the ATHENA trial suggests that dronedarone may be a more cost-effective long-term AAD strategy compared to amiodarone and sotalol for patients with paroxysmal or persistent AF in China from the health system perspective. The incremental cost associated with dronedarone was effectively offset by cumulative benefits in life expectancy and QALY in the long-term rhythm control. However, to apply this evidence effectively in clinical or\nCRediT authorship contribution statement",
