  "content": "Conclusions\nIn a contemporary clinical trial involving patients with AF at risk for stroke, amiodarone use was substantial and varied by geographic region. Anticoagulation quality, as assessed by TTR, was lower in warfarin-treated patients who received amiodarone, and amiodarone use was associated with a significantly higher risk of stroke and systemic embolism. The relative effects of apixaban versus warfarin on stroke and systemic embolism, mortality, and major bleeding were consistent in patients who received and patients who did not receive amiodarone.\nPerspectives",
