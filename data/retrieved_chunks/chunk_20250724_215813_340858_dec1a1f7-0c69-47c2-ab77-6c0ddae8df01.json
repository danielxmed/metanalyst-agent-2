  "content": "Recurrent paroxysmal atrial fibrillation may be treated for maintenance of sinus rhythm in selected patients with class IC antiarrhythmic drugs (in conjunction with negative dromotropic agent) or class III antiarrhythmic drugs; however, eventually, the atrial fibrillation becomes resistant to prevention or cardioversion (376), and control of ventricular response becomes the mainstay of therapy. Digoxin slows the heart rate response in patients with atrial fibrillation and MS (415). However, heart rateâ€“regulating calcium channel blockers or beta blockers are more effective for preventing exercise-induced increases in heart rate",
