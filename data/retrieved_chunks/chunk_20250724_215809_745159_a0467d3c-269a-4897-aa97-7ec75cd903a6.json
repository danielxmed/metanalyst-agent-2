  "content": "As with the oral form, intravenous amiodarone has a complex pharmacology that begins with its formulation (). Because it is not water soluble, the commercial preparation uses a solvent—polysorbate-80—that may contribute to the hypotensive effect of the commercially available compound (). Polysorbate-80 has also been shown to decrease heart rate, depress atrioventricular (AV) node conduction and increase atrial and ventricular refractory periods (). Once infused, a large percentage of amiodarone is protein bound predominantly to albumin and also to beta-lipoprotein and alpha-1 acid glycoprotein, an acute-phase reactant ([13, 14]). The drug is metabolized mainly by a P450cytochrome oxidase (CYP3A4)-dependent oxidative deethylation",
