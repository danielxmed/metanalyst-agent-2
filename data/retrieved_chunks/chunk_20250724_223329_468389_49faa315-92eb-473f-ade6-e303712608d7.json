  "content": "Amiodarone also has class I, II, and IV antiarrhythmic effects. It decreases conduction velocity by blocking sodium channels (class I effect), produces noncompetitive Î²-blockade (class II effect) that can cause substantial sinus bradycardia within several days (peak, 3 months),7 and reduces inward L-type (slow) calcium channel activity (class IV effect) in a use-dependent fashion. Inhibition of thyroxine (T 4) deiodination to triiodothyronine (T 3) may contribute to antiarrhythmic efficacy. Expected thyroid function tests include normal or mildly increased levels of thyrotropin, decreased levels of T 3, and increased levels of T 4 and reverse T 3.11 These changes usually occur without relevant clinical effects.",
