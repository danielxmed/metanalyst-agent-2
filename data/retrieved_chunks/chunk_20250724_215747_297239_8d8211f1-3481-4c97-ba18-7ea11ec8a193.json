Many factors influence the effectiveness of pharmacological cardioversion, such as the dura-tion of AF or the presence of cardiac or valvular diseases: the highest conversion rates are reported for AF of short duration in otherwise ‘healthy’ pa-tients. Drug comparisons are flawed by the inade-quate methodology of trials . Nonetheless, Vaughan-Williams class Ic and III drugs, such as flecainide, propafenone, ibutilide, dofetilide and amiodarone, are usually considered effective drugs [37, 65–68] (table 3).
