  "content": "Drug Interactions \nAmiodarone interacts with many other drugs.7 Perhaps the most important interaction is warfarin potentiation15; warfarin dosage must be reduced when initiating amiodarone, and international normalized ratios should be closely assessed for several months. Elevation of digoxin levels is also common; dose reduction (50%) and close monitoring of serum digoxin levels is recommended. Amiodarone can cause significant sinus or AV nodal depression, especially when combined with Î²-blockers or calcium channel blockers. Additional drug-drug interactions are listed in Box 2.\nBox Section Ref ID Box 2. Interactions of Amiodarone With Specific Other Drugs",
