  "content": "Measurement of Outcomes\nThe primary outcome of our study was long-term recurrence of AF. The long-term recurrence of AF was defined as any atrial tachyarrhythmias lasting 30 seconds or longer after the post-90-day blanking period. Corresponding to it, we defined the recurrence of AF within 3 months after CA as the blanking-period AF recurrence. The secondary outcomes were the blanking-period AF recurrence, rehospitalization for re-ablation, and adverse drug events (ADE), including bleeding, hepatic dysfunction or renal dysfunction, skin sensibility, gastrointestinal adverse reactions, bradyarrhythmia (<55bpm), ischemic stroke, and hyperthyroidism.",
