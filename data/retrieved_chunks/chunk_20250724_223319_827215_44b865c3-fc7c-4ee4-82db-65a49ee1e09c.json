  "content": "Beta-blocker therapy in treatment of atrial fibrillation\nBeta-adrenergic blockers have been an option in the control of ventricular response in AF for many years; but recently, beta-blockers, along with calcium channel blockers, have replaced digoxin as first-line therapy for AF rate control. Randomized studies have confirmed the superiority of beta-blockers in controlling the ventricular response, especially with exercise (13).",
