  "content": ". 14,38 Intolerance to amiodarone was mostly attributed to the thyroid. 39 To prevent GI side effects, we recommend that patients consumed dronedarone during meals. Patients with GI side effects were administered proton pump inhibitor. However, in our study, the thyroid toxicity of amiodarone was not evident, which might be related to its short-term use. Subclinical hyperthyroidism should be monitored. In a comparative study, the incidence of stroke in the amiodarone group was significantly higher than that in the dronedarone group, and the risk of interstitial liver disease was 10 times higher than that in the dronedarone group. 40 Amiodarone and its main metabolites can enhance the anticoagulant effects of warfarin and increase the risk of severe bleeding",
