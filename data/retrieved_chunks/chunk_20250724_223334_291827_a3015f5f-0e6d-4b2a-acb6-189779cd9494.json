  "content": "Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a common arrhythmic disease with an increased risk of mortality, disability, and hospitalizations.1,2 Hospitalizations occur more frequently in patients with AF compared to patients not affected by this arrhythmia. A nationwide retrospective cohort study including 4,602,264 hospital admissions3 showed a higher risk of both cardiovascular and noncardiovascular hospitalization at 6 months in AF compared to non-AF patients (28.4% vs 1.8% and 33.3% vs 9.7%, respectively).3 However, the study did not report reasons for hospitalization, as well as data on anticoagulation status of patients, and was conducted before the introduction of direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) (1997-2009).",
