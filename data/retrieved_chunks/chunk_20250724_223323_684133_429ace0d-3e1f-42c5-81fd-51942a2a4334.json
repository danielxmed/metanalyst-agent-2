  "content": "Mortality \nEighteen studies12,16-28,30-33 reported specific data on mortality during an observation period ranging from 3 hours to 30 days. In 12 studies, the observation period ranged from 1 to 3 days. Five of 816 patients died in the amiodarone groups compared with 5 of 696 in the comparison groups. The small numbers of deaths precluded further analysis. Three studies16,21,24 accounted for all of the reported deaths, and 1 of these16 for 4 deaths in each group, none of which appeared to be related to the study drugs.\nAdverse Events",
