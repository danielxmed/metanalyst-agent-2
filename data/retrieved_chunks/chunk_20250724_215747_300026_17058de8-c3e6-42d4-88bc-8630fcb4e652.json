  "content": "Results\nOf the 101 patients who were enrolled, 34 were randomized to amiodarone, 32 to propafenone and 35 to placebo. There were no significant differences between the three groups regarding age, gender, duration of atrial fibrillation, underlying cardiac disease, baseline ventricular rate, left atrial size or left ventricular ejection fraction measured echocardiographically (Table 1). Twelve patients (4 on amiodarone, 3 on propafenone and 5 on placebo) had had previous successful cardioversion (seven electrical). Seven of these 12 were under medication for the maintenance of sinus rhythm (four on sotalol, two on disopyramide, one on quinidine). These medications were discontinued five half-lives before the time of the patientsâ€™ entry to the study.\nOpen in Viewer",
