  "content": "Atrial fibrillation (AF) patients who need to take anticoagulants often have many comorbidities, and concomitant multiple medications, including amiodarone, are becoming more prevalent for these patients in guideline-driven practice . Although complicated due to its side effects, amiodarone is a potent and frequently used anti-arrhythmic drug that can be prescribed for AF patients with significant structural heart disease. However, amiodarone has drug interactions related to multiple metabolizing enzymes. All four non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs), dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban, and edoxaban act as substrates for the gastrointestinal lumen-located efflux transporter permeability-glycoprotein (P-glycoprotein), or are metabolized by cytochrome P450 to varying degrees",
