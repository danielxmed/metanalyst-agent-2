  "content": ". However, the results reported were disparate. One trial14 reported significant benefits from amiodarone in patients receiving concomitant β-blocker therapy but not in patients not receiving β-blocker therapy while another trial15 reported the reverse interaction. The third trial17 reported a nonsignificant increase in risk of atrial tachyarrhythmia in patients receiving concomitant β-blocker therapy and a nonsignificant benefit in patients not receiving concomitant β-blocker therapy, while the fourth16 reported that combined amiodarone and β-blocker therapy was prophylactic but neither amiodarone nor β-blocker therapy was when administered alone. The PAPABEAR trial demonstrates that the atrial tachyarrhythmia risk reduction with amiodarone is comparable in each of these subgroups",
