  "content": "The 2014 American Heart Association (AHA)/American College of Cardiology (ACC)/ Heart Rhythm Society (HRS) practice guidelines for the management of patients with atrial fibrillation (20) recommend the use of beta-blockers or nondihydropyridine calcium channel antag-onists for rate control in patients with NOAF without pre-excitation. Esmolol, propranolol and metoprolol have been shown to be effective (21-23), are available in intravenous formulations, and are titratable to avoid excessive bradycardia and hypotension. Nondihydropyridine calcium channel antagonists, such as verapamil or diltiazem, are alternatives for patients with contraindications to beta-blockers",
