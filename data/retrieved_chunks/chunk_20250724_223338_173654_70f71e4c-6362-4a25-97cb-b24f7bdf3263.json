  "content": ".79   Show abstract Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a common arrhythmia that is associated with substantial morbidity and mortality, particularly due to stroke and thromboembolism. Anticoagulant therapy reduces the risk of stroke, and the greatest benefit is seen in patients at highest absolute risk. Aspirin is a less effective alternative, and any benefit of aspirin might be due to its favourable effects on arterial thrombosis caused by vascular disease. However, anticoagulant therapy remains underused, particularly in the elderly, who probably have the most to gain from stroke prevention owing to their high absolute risk",
