  "content": "1. Pharmacological therapy to prevent recurrence of AF\nMaintenance of sinus rhythm is relevant in patients with paroxysmal AF (in whom episodes terminate spontaneously) and persistent AF (in whom electrical or pharmacological cardioversion is necessary to restore sinus rhythm). Whether paroxysmal or persistent, AF is a chronic disorder, and recurrence is likely at some point in most patients (Fig. 4)(109,110). Prophylactic treatment with antiarrhythmic drugs is therefore often necessary. The goal of maintenance therapy is suppression of symptoms and sometimes prevention of tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy due to AF. It is not yet known whether maintenance of sinus rhythm prevents thromboembolism, HF, or death (80,111).",
