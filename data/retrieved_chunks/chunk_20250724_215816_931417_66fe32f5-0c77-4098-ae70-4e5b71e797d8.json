Cost-effectiveness of rhythm control medications Patients taking rhythm-control drugs lived an average of 14 QALY, with average lifetime treatments costs of $10745. Among the rhythm-control medications, the cost per QALY for pilsic-ainide was lowest ($638/QALY), while that for amiodarone was highest ($986/QALY). Flecainide, propafenone, and dronedar-one had costs per QALY of $834, $830, and $824/QALY, re-spectively. Sotalol and pilsicainide had incremental cost ($453 and $996) and incremental effectiveness (2 and 3 QALY), dem-onstrating ICER values of $324/QALY and $332/QALY, respec-tively, compared with atenolol",
