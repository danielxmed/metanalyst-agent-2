  "content": "Methods\nA Markov decision model was developed to compare the lifetime clinical efficacy and costs of three AAD therapies associated with AF recurrence, congestive heart failure, strokes, and deaths due to AF or AF related complications. Model inputs were derived from the ATHENA trial results, real-world database, published literature, and supplemented from expert opinion. Cost-effectiveness was measured by the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER), defined as the incremental cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained among groups. One-way sensitivity, probabilistic sensitivity, and scenario analyses were performed to explore the uncertainty of the model.\nFindings",
