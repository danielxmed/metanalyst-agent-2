  "content": "Major exclusion criteria were: contraindications to treatment with beta-adrenergic blocking agents (i.e., presence or history of AV-block II/III, sick sinus syndrome, asthma), chronic oral treatment with amiodarone within six months prior to inclusion, concomitant treatment with any class 1 or 3 antiarrhythmic drug within five half-lives of that drug, cardiac surgery in the previous two months, clinical need for concomitant treatment with beta-blockers, and untreated thyroid dysfunction. Excluded from the study were patients with the paroxysmal form of atrial fibrillation or a history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, defined as recurrent episodes of atrial fibrillation alternating with sinus rhythm (22).",
