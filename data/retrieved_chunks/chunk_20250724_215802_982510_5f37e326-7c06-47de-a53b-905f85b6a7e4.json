  "content": ". During the administration period and assessments at weeks 12 and 24, both amiodarone and digoxin were equally effective in controlling ventricular rate during both ambulatory activity and peak exercise; however, they were equally less effective in altering rhythm irregularities . It is important to note that patients in this clinical trial had the following underlying heart diseases: hypertension, ischaemic heart disease, and dilated cardiomyopathy. That being said, neither amiodarone nor digoxin significantly differed in impacting a patient's exercise capacity, quality of life, and AF symptoms; therefore both drugs are equally effective and either can be administered . No deaths were observed in this clinical trial .",
