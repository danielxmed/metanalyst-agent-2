  "content": ". The guidelines also stress healthcare equity, advocating for the elimination of disparities related to sex, ethnicity, disability, and socioeconomic status. For diagnosis, electrocardiographic confirmation of clinical AF is essential, followed by risk stratification using the CHA₂DS₂-VASc score to guide anticoagulation therapy. Direct oral anticoagulants are preferred for most patients because of their good safety profile. Stroke prevention is prioritized, with rhythm control as first-line treatment for suitable patients. For those with persistent symptoms despite medications, catheter ablation is recommended. Rate control strategies, including beta-blockers, digoxin, and calcium channel blockers, are used to manage heart rate and symptoms",
