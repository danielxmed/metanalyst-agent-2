AF did not recur in any of the 5 persistent AF patients (100%), and 7/12 permanent AF patients (58%), translating to SR maintenance in 12/17 (71%) patients receiving cardioversion with a median follow-up of 216 days. Recurrence of AF among treatment failures was within 1 month with a median length of 16 days (Fig. 2). In total, amiodarone was effective in 100% and 35% of the persistent and permanent AF patients, respectively. Among 14 patients who had previously failed to cardiovert with other antiarrhythmic agents (range, 1â€“7 agents), amiodarone was effective in 9.",
