  "content": "Most adverse effects are reversible via dose reduction or discontinuation of amiodarone. Hyperthyroidism may exacerbate atrial fibrillation (AF) or precipitate ventricular tachyarrhythmias, and amiodarone should therefore be discontinued in patients with hyperthyroidism. Electrical storm or failure of pharmacosuppression may require thyroidectomy.18,19Quiz Ref ID Fatal complications such as pulmonary fibrosis, cirrhosis, and bradycardia leading to cardiac arrest have been reported.12,20-22 Risk factors for pulmonary fibrosis include underlying lung disease, amiodarone dosages greater than 400 mg/d, cumulative dosage, and recent pulmonary insults.23 Follow-up is mandatory to detect, limit, and/or reverse adverse effects",
