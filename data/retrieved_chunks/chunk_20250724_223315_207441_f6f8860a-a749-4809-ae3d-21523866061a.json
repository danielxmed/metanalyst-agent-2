  "content": ". Other randomized trials have also demonstrated that amiodarone is an effective anti-arrhythmic drug in conversion to sinus rhythm. Hou et al.  evaluated the treatment of recent-onset atrial fibrillation using amiodarone and digoxin and found that 24 of 26 cases of AF had converted back to sinus rhythm 24 hours after the administration of amiodarone, while only 17 of 24 cases of AF in the digoxin group had converted to sinus rhythm. Despite this high rate of conversion observed after digoxin administration, it was recorded that of the 17 episodes of conversion to sinus rhythm, four patients had a recurrence of AF, while only one of the patients in the amiodarone group showed recurrence of AF",
