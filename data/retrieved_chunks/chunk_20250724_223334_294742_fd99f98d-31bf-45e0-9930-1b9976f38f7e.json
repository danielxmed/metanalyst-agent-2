  "content": "Several studies have examined whether atrial fibrillation is an important risk factor for prolonging hospitalization. In the large Multicenter Study of Perioperative Ischemia, 2,417 patients were studied (2). Patients with atrial fibrillation had a 2.0-day longer hospitalization than did those without atrial fibrillation. Similarly, Aranki (1)reported a single-center series of 570 patients. The length of stay for patients with atrial fibrillation was 15 days, compared with 9 days in those without atrial fibrillation (1). Both studies strongly supported the hypothesis that atrial fibrillation was an important independent variable in length of hospital stay. Daoud was the first to demonstrate that amiodarone treatment resulted in a shortening of hospitalization: 7",
