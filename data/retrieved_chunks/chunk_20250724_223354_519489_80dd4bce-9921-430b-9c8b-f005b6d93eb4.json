  "content": "Follow-up\nPhysicians blinded to the patient’s study group assessed patients for arrhythmia recurrence. Reviews were every 3 months for the first year and then every 6 months thereafter. At each review, AF recurrence was ascertained from patients’ symptoms, electrocardiograms, and ambulatory 7-day monitoring. Two independent observers blinded to patient group analyzed the ambulatory recordings. In the absence of any arrhythmia, antiarrhythmic drugs were stopped at 4 to 6 weeks. No patient continued on amiodarone after ablation. All patients underwent anticoagulation by using warfarin for≥3 months after ablation.\nProcedural success was determined as the absence of any atrial arrhythmia≥30 s after a 3-month blanking period.\nAF symptom burden",
