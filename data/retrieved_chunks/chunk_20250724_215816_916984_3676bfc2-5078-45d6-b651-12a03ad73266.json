However, these studies were limited by the lack of random-ized data on efficacy and resource use. Marshall, et al.24 per-formed an economic analysis of the Atrial Fibrillation Follow-up Investigation of Rhythm Management (AFFIRM)21 results and found non-significant differences in mean survival time, although treatment costs were always higher in the rhythm control group. In that study, the drug cost per day was greater for all of the rhythm-control drugs than the rate-control drugs",
