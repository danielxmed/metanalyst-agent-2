  "content": "Observational studies have shown an elevated risk of incident AF with a sedentary lifestyle [25–28]. Aerobic exercise interventions have been effective in reducing the burden of non-permanent AF while improving functional capacity, as measured by the 6-minute walk test (6 MWT), and enhancing the quality of life in both patients with permanent and non-permanent AF [29–31]. The 2023 ACTIVE-AF randomized clinical trial demonstrated that patients with paroxysmal or persistent symptomatic AF experienced fewer and shorter J. Clin. Med. 2024, 13, 7846 5 of 21 AF episodes, reduced symptom burden, and improved cardiorespiratory fitness when moderate-to-vigorous exercise (targeting 210 min per week) was supplemented to their usual care",
