  "content": "Both Matthew and Aranki also provided strong evidence that atrial fibrillation significantly prolonged hospitalization and increased resource utilization (1,2). In the Perioperative Ischemia study, both prolonged hospitalization (two days) and extra time in the intensive care unit (13 h) were noted. Aranki (1)demonstrated that atrial fibrillation was associated with an extra 4.9 days of hospitalization with estimated additional charges of $10,055.\nAmiodarone and atrial fibrillation after open heart surgery",
