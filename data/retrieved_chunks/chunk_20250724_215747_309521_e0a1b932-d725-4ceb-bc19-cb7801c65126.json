  "content": ". In a randomized trial comparing intravenous dofetilide with amiodarone and placebo in patients with AF of up to two months duration (26), dofetilide achieved a higher cardioversion rate than amiodarone and placebo (35%, 4%, and 4% of patients respectively). However, the follow-up period in that study was only 3 h, which may have been insufficient to show efficacy of amiodarone. Furthermore, 8% of the patients receiving dofetilide had torsade de pointes. These new class III agents are most useful for cardioverting atrial flutter, with efficacy rates of over 50% 24, 25, 26.",
