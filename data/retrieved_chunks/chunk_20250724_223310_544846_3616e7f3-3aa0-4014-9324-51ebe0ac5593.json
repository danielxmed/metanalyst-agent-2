  "content": "Methods\nWe searched Medline and EMBASE databases, as well as the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register for randomized trials on recent-onset AF comparing amiodarone to placebo or class Ic drugs. Data were combined according to a fixed effect model. The primary end point was the rate of conversion at 24 h. To study time-dependency of the drugs, efficacy at 1 to 2 h, 3 to 5 h, 6 to 8 h, and at 24 h was analyzed.\nResults",
