  "content": "Amiodarone is the drug recommended for rate control of AF with rapid ventricular response in patients with chronic heart failure in whom beta-blockers cannot be administered. Amiodarone shows little negative inotropic effect and can be used in patients with reduced left ventricular function. The recent European Society of Cardiology (ESC) Guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of acute and chronic heart failure 2012  recommended anticoagulation, electrical cardioversion in cases when urgent restoration of sinus rhythm is required, administration of amiodarone for pharmacological cardioversion in cases of AF duration <48 h, and digitalis in patients with acute heart failure and AF with a rapid ventricular response",
