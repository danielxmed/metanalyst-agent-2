  "content": "The EP measurements were available for 57% of the patients (358 of 624) followed to 8 weeks and 60% (332 of 557) of those followed to 1 year. Figure 3shows the comparisons of the mean changes in maximal exercise duration. Overall, the increase in exercise tolerance in the SR group was significantly higher than that in the AF group at 8 weeks (81.5 s vs. 33.5 s; p = 0.01) and at 1 year (74.6 s vs. 15.2 s; p = 0.02). The exercise duration was not significantly affected by amiodarone or sotalol. For the symptomatic subgroup, a greater increase in exercise duration was observed in SR patients (n = 123) versus AF patients (n = 102) at 8 weeks (80.1 s vs. 17.3 s; p = 0",
