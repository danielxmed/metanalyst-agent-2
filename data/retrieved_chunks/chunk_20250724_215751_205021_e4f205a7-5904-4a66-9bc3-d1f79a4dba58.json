  "content": "Over the course of the follow-up period, adverse effects occurred in 24 (50%) patients. Recorded adverse effects were bradycardia in 7 (15%), thyroid dysfunction (all hypothyroidism) in 10 (21%), pulmonary events in 8 (17%), excessive QT prolongation (QTc>0.52) in 3 (6%), and liver dysfunction in 1 (2%). Amiodarone was discontinued in 11 (23%) of these patients (thyroid dysfunction 3, pulmonary events 7, and liver dysfunction 1). In the remaining 13, amiodarone dosage was decreased, or treatment for thyroid dysfunction was initiated. Among 7 patients who showed bradycardia, 5 had sinus bradycardia of 40â€“60 BPM and in the other 2 patients sick sinus syndrome was revealed and pacemakers were implanted",
