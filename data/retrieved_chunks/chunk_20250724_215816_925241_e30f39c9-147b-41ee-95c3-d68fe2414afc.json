  "content": "This study used a simulated cohort with baseline characteristics of patients from the CCC-AF project. In the base case, compared to amiodarone and sotalol, dronedarone was expected to gain additional 1.28 QALYs (5.15 vs 3.87) and 1.78 QALYs (5.15 vs 3.37), with higher costs of $6632 ($11,025 vs $4393) and $6278 ($11,025 vs $4748) over a lifetime horizon, leading to ICERs of $5166 and $3524 per QALY, respectively. One-way sensitivity analysis revealed that the results were most sensitive to the relative risk of cardiovascular mortality, the discount rate of QALYs, and the utility for sinus rhythm. The probabilistic sensitivity analyses indicated that the probability of cost-effectiveness for dronedarone ranged from 97.0% to 99",
