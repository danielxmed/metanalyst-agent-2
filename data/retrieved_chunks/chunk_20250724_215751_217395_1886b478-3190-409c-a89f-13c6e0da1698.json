  "content": "Amiodarone, a class III antiarrhythmic drug, is known for its effectiveness in treating arrhythmias. It is also readily available, cost-effective, and commonly prescribed for managing arrhythmias in patients with structural heart disease. However, approximately 15% to 20% of individuals undergoing amiodarone treatment experience thyroid-related issues, specifically either amiodarone-induced hypothyroidism or amiodarone-induced thyrotoxicosis (AIT).7 The prevalence of AIT varies widely, influenced by iodine intake, amiodarone dose, and pre-existing thyroid conditions. AIT affects 3% to 10% of patients on amiodarone, with type 2 being more common in iodine-sufficient regions.8, 9, 10 The prevalence of the 2 main forms of AIT has changed over time",
