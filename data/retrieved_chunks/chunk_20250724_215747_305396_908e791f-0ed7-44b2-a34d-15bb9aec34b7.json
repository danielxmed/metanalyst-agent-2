  "content": "Even if cardioversion may be delayed compared with class Ic drugs, amiodarone has the advantage of promptly slowing a rapid ventricular rate 8, 10, 11, 17. This may be due to predominant beta-adrenergic and calcium channel blockade observed early after intravenous amiodarone injection, the class III effect being least identifiable at this stage (21). Flecainide, on the other hand, shows little slowing of atrioventricular nodal conduction. Furthermore, this compound has been shown to increase defibrillation thresholds, whereas amiodarone has been shown to enhance electrical cardioversion (23).",
