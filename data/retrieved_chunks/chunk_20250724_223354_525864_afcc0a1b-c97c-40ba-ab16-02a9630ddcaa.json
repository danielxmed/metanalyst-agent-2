  "content": "The median follow-up was 2.1 years (range, 0.4-2.5 years). The median cumulative dose of amiodarone in the episodic group was 48 g (range, 16 -178 g) vs 123 g (range, 19-203 g) in the continuous treatment group (P<.001). During follow-up, the sum serum levels of amiodarone and desethylamiodarone were significantly higher in the continuous group. In the episodic group, more first atrial fibrillation recurrences occurred (85 [80%] vs 56 [54%], P<.001). In total, 132 relapses occurred in the episodic group vs 77 in the continous treatment group. At the time of first atrial fibrillation recurrence, 56 of 85 patients (66%) in the episodic group did not use amiodarone, whereas 18 of 56 patients (32%) did not use amiodarone in the continuous group",
