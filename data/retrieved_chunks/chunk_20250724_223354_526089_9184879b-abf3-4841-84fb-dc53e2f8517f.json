  "content": ". 14 The present study suggested that dronedarone and amiodarone had almost identical effects on preventing AF recurrence of atrial fibrillation after the blanking period. Our study suggested that the effectiveness of either drug in maintaining sinus rhythm was modest. Based on the follow-up, the rehospitalization rates for re-ablation between these two",
