  "content": "Atrial fibrillation carries an excess risk of mortality and morbidity. However, maintenance of sinus rhythm has no effect on mortality. To determine the effect of sinus rhythm (SR) versus atrial fibrillation (AF) on quality of life (QOL) and exercise performance, we analyzed the data from the SAFE-T (Sotalol Amiodarone Atrial Fibrillation Efficacy Trial) study. Sinus rhythm was associated with some improvement in QOL measures on the SF-36, symptom checklist, specific activity scale, and AF severity scale. All improvement in QOL measures favored the symptomatic versus the asymptomatic patients. Exercise performance improved significantly in SR compared with AF, with a strong correlation between QOL and exercise duration in patients with SR.\nAbstract\nObjectives:",
