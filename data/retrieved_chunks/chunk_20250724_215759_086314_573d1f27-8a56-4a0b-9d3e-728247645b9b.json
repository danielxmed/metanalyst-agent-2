  "content": "Efficacy of amiodarone versus placebo\nCompared with placebo, amiodarone significantly prevented AF in follow-up (Fig. 2A), with an OR of 0.12 (95% CI: 0.08 to 0.19) and a risk difference of −0.401 (95% CI: −0.46 to −0.34) equivalent to 401 fewer events per 1,000 patients treated. For mortality, the OR was 1.88 (95% CI: 0.54 to 6.56), with a risk difference of 0.005 (95% CI: −0.016 to 0.026). For adverse events requiring discontinuation, there was a significant increase over placebo with an OR of 11.04 (95% CI: 1.89 to 64.5) and risk difference of 0.128 (95% CI: 0.023 to 0.230).\nComparative efficacy of dronedarone and amiodarone",
