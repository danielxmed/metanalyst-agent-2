  "content": "AF episodes A total of eight studies including 1370 participants met the inclusion criteria for the comparison of AF episode analysis.\nPooled analysis in Figure 1 showed no significant difference in AF episodes between the amiodarone group and beta-blocker group (RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.66, 1.04, p=0.10).\nAF duration Three studies, including 384 participants, allocated into the amiodarone group (n=189) and beta-blocker group (n=195) compared the duration of AF. In accordance to the comparable risk of AF episode, pooled analysis in Figure 2 also showed no significant difference in terms of AF duration between both groups (SMD 0.46, 95% CI -1.1 to 2.05, p=0.57).",
