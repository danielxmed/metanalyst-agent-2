  "content": "The use of class IA antiarrhythmic drugs in AF has been associated with excess mortality24, 25. Whether class IC or class III agents, including amiodarone, are associated with higher mortality in patients with AF has been controversial. Excess mortality has not been noted in a pooled analysis of class IC and class III drugs after cardioversion (26). However, antiarrhythmic drug therapy in the AFFIRM study, which included amiodarone, sotalol, and 6 class I antiarrhythmic drugs, was associated with excess mortality (27), and noncardiovascular mortality was increased in patients on amiodarone 15, 16. Reports of increased cancer rates with amiodarone have been published 13, 14.",
