  "content": "Using a propensity scoreâ€“adjusted analysis, patients who received amiodarone had a significantly higher rate of stroke or systemic embolism compared with those who did not receive amiodarone. The rate of stroke or systemic embolism was 1.58%/year in patients who received amiodarone and 1.19% in those who did not receive amiodarone (adjusted HR: 1.47; 95% CI: 1.03 to 2.10; p= 0.0322). Patients who received amiodarone had numerically, but not significantly, higher rates of all-cause death (4.76% vs. 4.09%; adjusted HR: 1.16; 95% CI: 0.95 to 1.41), cardiovascular death (2.65% vs. 2.26%; adjusted HR: 1.2; 95% CI: 0.91 to 1.55), and noncardiovascular death (1.49% vs. 1.09%; HR: 1.27; 95% CI: 0.88 to 1.82)",
