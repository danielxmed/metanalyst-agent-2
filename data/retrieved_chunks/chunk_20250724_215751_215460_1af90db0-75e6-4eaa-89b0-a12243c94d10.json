  "content": "Primary End Point. Primary end point consisted of amiodarone and underlying heart disease–related major adverse events. The major events that were associated with amiodarone included cardiovascular effects; hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism; pulmonary and hepatic toxicity; and dermatological, ophthalmologic, neurological, and gastrointestinal tract effects. Cardiovascular effects were defined as symptomatic sinus bradycardia with a heart rate lower than 40/min, sinus arrest longer than 4 seconds, atrioventricular conduction disturbances necessitating pacemaker implantation, or ventricular proarrhythmia. Thyroid dysfunction could be clinical, biochemical, or both",
