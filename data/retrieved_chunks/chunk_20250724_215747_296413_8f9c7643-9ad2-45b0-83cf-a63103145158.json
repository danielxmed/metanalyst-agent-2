  "content": "Gillmann et al found that in 23% of individuals, electrical cardioversion followed by medicine resulted in a conversion to sinus rhythm. Amiodarone was more effective for cardio-version . Amiodarone can be very effective in controlling rate and rhythm after beta-blocker therapy . Dofetilide (DF) and sotalol (SL) are class III antiarrhythmics with mini-mal non-cardiac side effects, often studied in cases of NOAF in sepsis. Dofetilide blocks the rapid delayed rectifier potas-sium current (IKr), extending action potential duration and QT interval by delaying repolarization, which prolongs the refractory periods of the His-Purkinje system and ventricles",
