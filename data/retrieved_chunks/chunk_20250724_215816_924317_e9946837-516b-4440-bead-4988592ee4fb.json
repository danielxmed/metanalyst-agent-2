Such a counterintuitive trend suggests a sophisticated dy-namic between disease prevalence and management strategies, which invites us to consider the possibility of significant ad-vancements in AF management practices, capable of mitigat-ing the economic and logistical challenges posed by increas-ing prevalence.
