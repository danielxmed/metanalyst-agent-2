Amiodarone was discontinued in the episodic treatment group 4 weeks after randomization and was restarted a month before and continued a month after cardioversion if atrial fibrillation had relapsed. Amiodarone treatment was maintained for those in the continuous treatment group. Patients experiencing recurrence in either group were reloaded with 600 mg of amiodarone daily for 4 weeks if the sum of their amiodarone and desethylamiodarone serum levels was lower than 1 mg/L or for 2 weeks if the sum was lower than 2 mg/L. Patients in both groups were subsequently scheduled for an electrical cardioversion",
