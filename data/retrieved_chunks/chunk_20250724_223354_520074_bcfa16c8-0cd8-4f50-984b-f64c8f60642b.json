  "content": "This study shows that episodic amiodarone treatment—in contrast to our expectations—has no clinical advantage over continuous treatment because it did not lower morbidity in patients with persistent atrial fibrillation over 2 years of follow-up. In addition, episodic treatment is associated with more frequent recurrences of atrial fibrillation and cardioversion procedures, more patients with multiple recurrences, and a lower rate of chronic sinus rhythm at 2 years. In the episodic treatment group, there was a decreased incidence of amiodarone-related events and an increased incidence of underlying heart disease–related events; while these differences were not statistically significant, this study was underpowered to make this determination",
