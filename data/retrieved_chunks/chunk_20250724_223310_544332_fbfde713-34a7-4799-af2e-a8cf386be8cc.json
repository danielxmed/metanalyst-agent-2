  "content": "We identified 11 RCTs. All continued β-blockers postoperatively, making it unfeasible to separate the benefits of preoperative vs postoperative administration. Meta-analysis was precluded by methodologic variation in β-blocker utilized, timing and dosage, and supplemental and comparison treatments. Of the eight comparisons of β-blockers/β-blocker plus digoxin versus placebo (n= 826 patients), six showed significant reductions in atrial fibrillation/supraventricular arrhythmias. Of the three comparisons (n= 444) of β-blockers versus amiodarone, two found no significant difference in atrial fibrillation; the third showed significantly lower incidence with amiodarone",
