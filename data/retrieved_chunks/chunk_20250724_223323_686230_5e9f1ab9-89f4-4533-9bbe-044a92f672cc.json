  "content": "The concern about cancer and amiodarone use in humans was based on the results from a meta-analysis of 15 trials, 4 of which reported cancer deaths. Of 1,609 patients who received amiodarone, 13 (0.8%) died of cancer. In comparison, of 1,597 patients who received placebo, 4 (0.3%) died of cancer (13). A more recent retrospective cohort study from Taiwan included patients who received amiodarone for >28 days without antecedent malignancy (14). Of 6,418 patients followed for a median of 2.57 years, 280 cancers developed, which was higher than would be expected. Cancer was not an endpoint of the ARISTOTLE trial, and the follow-up time was relatively brief for the detection of any possible association of amiodarone with cancer.\nStudy limitations",
