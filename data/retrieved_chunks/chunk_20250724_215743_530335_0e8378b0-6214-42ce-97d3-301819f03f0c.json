  "content": "In the combined database analysis of beta blockers versus amiodarone, rate control with beta blockers appeared superior in the unadjusted analysis, however, after adjustment, these differences were no longer evident (aHR 1.15 [0.91–1.46]), consistent with our individual database analyses (Supplementary Table S10, Additional File 2).\n3.6.2. Rhythm control\nCCBs were associated with inferior rhythm control (aHR 0.59 [0.37–0.92]) versus amiodarone in the USA database (Fig. 3). No difference was identified in rhythm control with beta blockers (aHR 0.91 [0.61–1.35]) or cardioversion (2.00 [CI 0.86–4.65]) versus amiodarone in the USA database.",
