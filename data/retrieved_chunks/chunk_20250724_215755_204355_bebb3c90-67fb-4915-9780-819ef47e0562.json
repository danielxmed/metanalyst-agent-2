  "content": "The odds of experiencing bradycardic adverse effects with amiodarone were significantly higher than with placebo, and the trend toward increased bradycardic adverse effects in the amiodarone group was a consistent finding among all four trials in this meta-analysis (Fig. 1g). Although it is generally regarded as a benign side effect, amiodarone-related bradycardia was implicated in one fatality . The severity of this adverse effect may be related to the patient group studied. Elderly patients with structural heart disease may be more predisposed to the bradycardic adverse effect of amiodarone, even when this drug is administered in low mean daily doses.",
