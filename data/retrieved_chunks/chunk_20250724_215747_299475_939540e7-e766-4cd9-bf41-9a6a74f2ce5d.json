  "content": ". However, placebo-controlled data on the value of beta-blockade after cardioversion of persistent atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter not associated with open heart surgery are lacking. We therefore conducted a multicenter, placebo-controlled, randomized, double-blind trial to test the hypothesis that metoprolol CR/XL (controlled release), a selective beta 1 adrenoceptor blocking drug, is effective in preventing relapse into atrial fibrillation following cardioversion.",
