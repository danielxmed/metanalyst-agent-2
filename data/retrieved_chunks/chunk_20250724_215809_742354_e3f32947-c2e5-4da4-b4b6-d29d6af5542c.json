  "content": "Warfarin is prescribed frequently to prevent stroke in patients with AF. Because amiodarone interferes with warfarin metabolism through the CYP 2C9 pathway, the international normalized ratio (INR) values are more difficult to maintain in a therapeutic range of 2 to 3 5, 6, 7, 8. This leads to a suboptimal time in the therapeutic range (TTR), which is associated with increased clinical events 9, 10. Noncardiovascular side effects are also concerns with amiodarone. In addition to well-known hepatic, thyroid, neurologic, and ophthalmologic side effects, amiodarone occasionally causes pulmonary toxicity, which may be life-threatening 11, 12, and it has also been associated with an increased risk of cancer 13, 14, 15",
