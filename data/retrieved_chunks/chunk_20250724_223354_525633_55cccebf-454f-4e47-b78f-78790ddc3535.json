  "content": "Enrollment lasted 42 months, and follow-up lasted a minimum of 12 and a maximum of 54 months. Supporting analyses included the time to the first recurrence of atrial fibrillation among patients with conversion on or before day 28 and among predefined subgroups based on the duration of atrial fibrillation and the presence or absence of symptoms or ischemic heart disease.\nTo account for differences in the duration of follow-up among the study groups, the rates of adverse events were calculated as the number of patients who had a particular adverse event at least once per 100 patient-years of follow-up. Logistic regression was used to compare the rates of adverse events among the study groups after adjustment for the duration of follow-up.\nResults\nCharacteristics of the Patients",
