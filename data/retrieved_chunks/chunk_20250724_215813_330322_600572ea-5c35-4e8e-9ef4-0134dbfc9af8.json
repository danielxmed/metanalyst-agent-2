  "content": "The efficacy of antiarrhythmic medications for AF has been assessed in a number of ways. Measurement of recurrence over six or 12 months provides a relatively pessimistic perspective, since AF recurs in approximately 50% no matter what kind of therapy is administered (except for amiodarone, where the recurrence rate may be slightly lower) (3). What these statistics fail to note is that occasional brief or well-tolerated recurrences may represent substantial improvement and an acceptable result of therapy. Since AF is a chronic condition, complete elimination of recurrence is unrealistic. As such, assessment of the relative reduction in frequency is best performed by generating Kaplan-Meier curves and comparing the median times to recurrence of AF between groups",
