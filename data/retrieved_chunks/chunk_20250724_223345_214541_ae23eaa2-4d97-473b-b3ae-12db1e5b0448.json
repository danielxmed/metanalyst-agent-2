  "content": ". There is convincing evidence that moderate and regular physical activity improves exercise tolerance and enhances health-related quality of life (QoL) in these patients [1, 2, 7]. Clinical trials and meta-analyses demonstrate a reduction in both all-cause and heart failure-related hospitalizations. Nevertheless, there remains uncertainty regarding the impact of this intervention on mortality or serious adverse events [8, 9, 10]. Moreover, clinical evidence has shown that cardiac rehabilitation and moderate physical activity reduce the duration of arrhythmic episodes in patients diagnosed with paroxysmal and persistent AF",
