In patients with estimated risk of stroke and thromboembolic events of 2% or greater per year, anticoagulation with a vitamin K antagonist or direct oral anticoagulant reduces stroke risk by 60% to 80% compared with placebo. In most patients, a direct oral anticoagulant, such as apixaban, rivaroxaban, or edoxaban, is recommended over warfarin because of lower bleeding risks. Compared with anticoagulation, aspirin is associated with poorer efficacy and is not recommended for stroke prevention.
