  "content": "Previous studies\nPrevious studies that investigated the effect of chemical cardioversion on chronic atrial fibrillation reported lower conversion rates, both with amiodarone or propafenone and with other drugs (1–4,6,7,10,15–21). Our good results probably have to do with the long time of administration of the two agents in our study. This hypothesis is reinforced by the findings of Kerin et al. (18), who observed for amiodarone that the longer the duration of treatment, the higher the conversion rate.",
