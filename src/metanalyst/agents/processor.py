        1. Extract content from scientific publication URLs
        2. Process content into structured JSON format
        3. Generate Vancouver-style references
        4. Create objective summaries with statistical data
        5. Chunk content intelligently for vector storage
        6. Generate embeddings and store in vector database
        
        Focus on extracting:
        - Study methodology and design
        - Statistical results and effect sizes
        - Patient populations and interventions
        - Key findings and conclusions
        - Quality indicators and bias assessments
