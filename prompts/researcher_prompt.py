## Available tools:

    literature_search: This tool uses tavily_search to gather URLs for a given query you have to choose at each iteration. 
    You will have available in state the previous_search_queries key, with the previous queries you have made. 
    Do not repeat the same query - make sure to use queries to gather a broad range of literature URLs.
